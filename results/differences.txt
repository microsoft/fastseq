The children, aged seven and two, were quick to alert neighbours by sounding the car horn once they realised their mother was unresponsive. A man hunt for the woman’s partner led to the arrest of a Hackam West local who police say was known to the victim. Police are investigating the domestic dispute and are treating the death as suspicious.

The gang used a sledgehammer to break down the door and a crow bar to force their way into the property. They then bound the couple together with gaffer tape and repeatedly pricked the male victim with a pin brooch while demanding cash. Police have now arrested five people in connection with the incident.

That idea did not take off, but now Tinko has his wish of seeing the four race each other before the Tour. Froome, the 2013 Tour de France winner, will lead a Team Sky squad which is also slated to include Elia Viviani.

Police who responded to the scene arrested Jill, 52, for murder, but later released her when the District Attorney ordered the case sent back to LAPD detectives for more investigation.

< D-5817	-0.0032213181257247925	Armed robbers are suspected of stealing $4million in gold from an 18-wheeler taking the precious from Florida to Massachusetts on Interstate 95. Two security guards working for Transvalue Inc of Miami reported pulling to the side of the interstate on Sunday evening after their vehicle began having mechanical problems. They were then approached by three armed men driving a white van. The men ordered the guards to lie on the ground, tied their hands behind their backs and marched them into nearby woods, before taking 275lbs of gold. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has joined in the search for the robbers, thought to be male and possibly Hispanic.

< D-7327	-0.0024133326951414347	Police are investigating a link between two separate ram raid robberies of jewellery stores performed within 24 hours. Dramatic footage of the first incident, which took place Kippax Fair shopping centre in north Canberra at 6.25 on Monday morning, has been issued by police. The thieves can be seen driving a stolen Subaru Impreza wagon through the front doors of the shopping centre, before doing an awkward three point turn inside and reversing into the jewellery shop. It’s the third time the store has been burgled in 12 months, with previoius break-ins in April and November.

The controversial bowl triggered a cold war between the two nations after the infamous day on February 1. New Zealand needed six runs with one ball remaining to draw the match. Aussie skipper Greg Chappell instructed the bowler, who was his younger brother Trevor, to deliver the ball underarm in a bid to prevent batsman Brian McKechnie hitting a six.

Johansen came on as a second half substitute in two matches for New York City during pre-season - first against Brondby and then in a Carolina Challenge Cup clash against Houston Dynamo. New York head coach Jason Kreis believes Johansen merely strengthens their options in the goalkeeping department.

Australia then made light work of the reply, which was interrupted for an hour and a half by a rain delay, with Michael Clarke top-scoring with 47.

Neale Postlethwaite, a farmer of 20 years from Gooroc, north of Melbourne, found the baby snake suspended above the ground on Saturday evening. 'I can't believe it was actually able to stop it and then hurl it up backwards into its nest,' he said. Eastern brown snakes contain enough venom to kill 20 adults with a single bite.

The prehistoric-looking goblin sharks live on deep sea bottoms and little is known about their lives. The shark had died by the time it was handed over, but it was still a priceless asset. Only four of them have been acquired by the Sydney museum - the first two collected in the 1980s.

But on grass, he has been totally dominant, unbeaten against all four in six matches. GB should forgo the cauldron of the Emirates Arena in Glasgow for the more sedate lawns of Nottingham or Eastbourne.

A silver BMW pulled up and a man jumped from the car. He grabbed the nurse, put his hand over her mouth and tried to drag her into the boot of his car. It was only after the nurse hit the man in the groin that he released his grip and she was able to make her escape. The nurse luckily only suffered cuts and bruises, although badly shaken by the incident.

< D-4169	-0.002617268357425928	Bournemouth let their promotion rivals steal a march at the top of the Championship after they were held to a 1-1 draw at Cardiff. Harry Arter fired in from range to give Eddie Howe's men an early lead, before Bruno Ecuele-Manga made the wasteful Cherries pay. Middlesborough's triumph at Derby and Watford's win against Wigan means Bournemouth slip two points behind the automatic places into third. Andre Gray's 84th-minute winner severely dented Blackburn's aims of finishing in the Sky Bet Championship play-off spots.

Harry Arter fired in from range to give Eddie Howe's men an early lead, before Bruno Ecuele-Manga made the wasteful Cherries pay. Middlesborough's triumph at Derby and Watford's win against Wigan means Bournemouth slip two points behind the automatic places into third. Andre Gray's 84th-minute winner severely dented Blackburn's aims of finishing in the Sky Bet Championship play-off spots.

This comes as Dinnigan sold her multi-million dollar Palm Beach home last year and earlier closed all of her boutiques so she could spend more time with her two young children.

< D-12084	-0.005141060799360275	Oysters have been grown at Porlock Bay in Somerset for the first time in 120 years. The natural crop was decimated by powerful trawlers which swept the beds clean. Now locals are reaping the benefits of a community-led project to reintroduce the shellfish industry to the area. The oysters are considered to be grown in such pure seawater they have been given grade A status by the Food Standards Agency.

They come amid an increasing anxiety about the number of young students fleeing to the Middle East to fight for ISIS.

< D-10291	-0.0030227943789213896	Two underground craters measuring 400km together in size have been discovered in central Australia. The impact zone was found in the Warburton basin in two parts, each 200km wide, indicating the meteor that created them split into two before smashing into the earth. The precise age of the crater is not yet known exactly, but researchers think it may be around 300 million years. Researchers strongly believe the meteor could have caused the end of many life species on the planet at the time, including the dinosaurs.

The cashier refused to hand over money and the pair fled the BP garage empty-handed.

< D-9857	-0.003779490478336811	The US Energy Department report on last year's accident at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad showed that a drum of waste containing radioisotopes like plutonium was improperly packaged at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The improper mix in the barrel, including the wrong sort of . kitty litter used to absorb liquids, sparked a chemical reaction causing it to heat up and generate gases that dislodged its lid, spewing radioactive materials.

> D-9857	-0.0037794902455061674	The US Energy Department report on last year's accident at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad showed that a drum of waste containing radioisotopes like plutonium was improperly packaged at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The improper mix in the barrel, including the wrong sort of . kitty litter used to absorb liquids, sparked a chemical reaction causing it to heat up and generate gases that dislodged its lid, spewing radioactive materials. The accident exposed 22 workers to radiation in amounts not expected to threaten their health.

Public records published on Findmypast.com on Friday trace Ned Kelly's path from before his father John Kelly became a criminal in Ireland to years later when he would eventually do the same in Australia. Prison transfer records show John Kelly, also known as Red, was arrested for stealing two pig back in 1841 and sent to Australia as a convict. He eloped with Ellen Quinn and they settled in the Victorian ranges north of Melbourne where he stole horses to supplement his income. The couple had seven children, including Ned, before he was arrested and jailed again.

The shooting wasn't a primary cause of death but it was a secondary - something else followed after she was shot,' Ms Kemper told Daily Mail Australia.

They found that, when material - dust or gas from nearby - falls onto a star, it can produce an extremely high pitched sound in the plasma. The sound wave is six million times higher in frequency than anything that can be heard by a mammal.

Both tombs feature astonishing murals which are believed to date back to the 18th Dynasty of the Egyptian New Kingdom. The tombs were found earlier this month near the Sheikh Abd el-Qurna dig site, situated at the feet of the Theban mountains. Luxor, a city of some 500,000 people on the banks of the Nile in southern Egypt, is an open-air museum of intricate temples.

Its stalling left crews working on the $80million project scrambling to determine how to rescue and repair the five-storey, 2,000-ton drill. It was able bore through nearly 20 feet of concrete last month to break through a wall leading to the rescue pit's opening. Now managers of the project are preparing to show off the cutting head as the refurbishment takes place. The machine's breakdown and other construction issues have left the highway project in Seattle two years behind schedule.

Hundreds of members of al Qaeda managed to escape from Yemeni prisons on Thursday and Friday. In addition, the Houthis issued a call to arms on Saturday to fight those loyal to President Hadi.

< D-2856	-0.004478953778743744	Martin Skrtel has been charged with violent conduct by the FA. The Slovakian defender is alleged to have deliberately trodden on David de Gea towards the end of Manchester United’s 2-1 win at Anfield on Sunday. The FA were able to take action after referee Martin Atkinson confirmed that he did not see the incident, and a three-man panel unanimously agreed that it was a red card offence. The 30-year-old has until 6pm on Tuesday to respond to the charge. Liverpool will already be missing Steven Gerrard for the next three games.

The FA were able to take action after referee Martin Atkinson confirmed that he did not see the incident, and a three-man panel unanimously agreed that it was a red card offence. The 30-year-old has until 6pm on Tuesday to respond to the charge. Liverpool will already be missing Steven Gerrard for the next three games.

After months of toiling the house is now beautifully renovated - but it doesn't have a new owner just yet. At the front, a new picket fence, synthetic lawn and roof have been added. Inside, the home there is now three bathrooms, and four good-sized bedrooms including one with an ensuite.

After months of toiling the house is now beautifully renovated - but it doesn't have a new owner just yet. At the front, a new picket fence, synthetic lawn and roof have been added. Inside, the home there is now three bathrooms, and four good-sized bedrooms including one with an ensuite. The house at 1 Charles Street failed to earn a single bid from the 30 people who came to see it go under the hammer.

He told authorities that he choked Etan in the basement of the convenience store where he worked after luring the boy down the stairs with a promise of a soda. But attorneys for Hernandez, now 54, say the confession was made up and Hernandez is mentally ill. He is asking to bring in the 50 pounds of potatoes and the produce box for jurors to demonstrate the weight of the body. The judge said he would decide on Thursday.

A new study published Monday in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases backed those initial opinions, after following the progress of 25 children in California and Colorado who experienced paralysis. Researchers now suggest that the children were infected with a mutated form of D-68, which first appeared four years ago.

Three years after meeting Robert Howard, 24, she decided she wanted to start a family and requested an appointment. But NHS officials told them they were not eligible for IVF because Robert has a child, four-year-old Eleanor, from a previous relationship.

> D-11188	-0.005378405097872019	Charlotte McPhillips, 23, was told as a teenager she would be unable to conceive naturally because she has polycystic ovary syndrome. Three years after meeting Robert Howard, 24, she decided she wanted to start a family and requested an appointment. But NHS officials told them they were not eligible for IVF because Robert has a child, four-year-old Eleanor, from a previous relationship. The couple are now taking their case to the European Court of Human Rights.

The mother, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, took photos of the incident on her camera phone which show Mr Davis tying her son's hands behind his back and ankles together. Despite her photo evidence, Dr Davis was hit with just a 12-month, $1000 good behaviour bond with no conviction recorded for the alleged assault. Another mother, Michelle Ridgen also claims Dr Davis carried out 'barbaric' acts when he treated her five-year-old son 10 years ago.

< D-6748	-0.003352686995640397	Researchers have identified a mass migration of Kurgan populations (Yamna culture) which went from the Russian steppes to the centre of Europe 4,500 years ago. DNA associated with the Yamnaya people appeared strongly in what is now northern Germany. This injection of DNA indicates 'a massive migration into the heartland of Europe from its eastern periphery,' said the researchers.

> D-6748	-0.0033526867628097534	Researchers have identified a mass migration of Kurgan populations (Yamna culture) which went from the Russian steppes to the centre of Europe 4,500 years ago. DNA associated with the Yamnaya people appeared strongly in what is now northern Germany. This injection of DNA indicates 'a massive migration into the heartland of Europe from its eastern periphery,' said the researchers. Such a large-scale influx would likely have affected not just the DNA but ancient cultures as well.

The predator grew to be around two metres (6.5 ft) in length and lived in lakes and rivers during the Late Triassic Period. With a mouth filled with sharp needle-like teeth it is thought to have preyed upon fish but could also have snapped up small early dinosaurs that got to close to the water.

She spoke candidly about the sexual assault in Vancouver by 'a friend' who she felt like she 'trusted' Moss, who was just 21 at the time of the attack, said he drove her to his house and invited her in for a cup of tea.

> D-6438	-0.003132456913590431	Tara Moss, 41, opened up to A Current Affair's Tracy Grimshaw on Wednesday night about being raped 20 years ago. She spoke candidly about the sexual assault in Vancouver by 'a friend' who she felt like she 'trusted' Moss, who was just 21 at the time of the attack, said he drove her to his house and invited her in for a cup of tea. The man was jailed for two years, but not for the assault on Moss. He was found guilty of rape against another woman when one of his friends testified against him.

< D-9180	-0.002894886303693056	San Francisco public defender Jeff Adachi has alleged that Deputy Scott Neu is ringleader behind organized fights between inmates that took place in March. Neu was the subject of two sexual assault lawsuits in 2006 and 2008, which were settled out of court. He was accused of orchestrating two fights at County Jail No. 4 between inmates Ricardo Palikiko Garcia and Stanley Harris as deputies placed bets on the outcome. Three other deputies Evan Staehely, Eugene Jones and Clifford Chiba have also been accused of forcing the inmates to fight. All four deputies have been placed on paid administrative leave pending an internal investigation.

In an obituary published in the Homer Tribune, Malcolm's daughter Megan writes that her father died 'nestled in the bosom of his family, while smoking, drinking whiskey and telling lies' 'He died from complications resulting from being stubborn, refusing to go to the doctor, and raising hell for six decades,' she writes.

The 19-year-old, who was seven months pregnant and had her 11-month-old daughter Dixie in the car, was conscious after the crash but complained of pain to her abdomen. She was taken to hospital where her twins - a boy and a girl - were born. The young mother suffered internal bleeding and sadly passed away after briefly holding her children, her devastated family revealed. Her cause of death has not yet been determined.

Now a team of scientists from Japan and Australia have proven that this 'spooky action at a distance' takes place in a photon. Professor Howard Wiseman at Griffiths University made measurements to show what Einstein did not believe to be real - namely the non-local collapse of a particle's 'wave function' By splitting a single photon between two laboratories, scientists used homodyne detectors - which measure wave-like properties - to show the collapse is a real effect.

To create the charged droplets, which measure just 25 nanometres, the team led by Philip Demokritou, sprayed water though a strong electrical field. Depending on how long fruit and vegetables were exposed to the spray of nanoparticles, lab tests showed that between 80 and 98 per cent of bacteria were destroyed.

He proposes that the Higgs boson itself - which gives particles their mass - could disintegrate into dark matter, and he’s hoping the team at Cern can prove his theory. Two independent experimental stations - Atlas and CMS - at the Large Hadron Collider are looking for the very properties his model predicts. If the properties are there, it is a clear indication that the model fits. ‘It's a dream for a theorist in particle physics,’ said Dr Petersson.

The collision brought the qualifying period to an abrupt halt with stewards running onto the track to help both drivers. Both drivers emerged from their cars unscathed but the famous racing car had to be winched onto a tow-truck.

< D-7937	-0.0039018800016492605	Gilbert Drogheo, from Harlem, was shot on the mezzanine section of the Borough Hall station in Downtown Brooklyn at 6.30pm on Tuesday. Two other men, a 29-year-old friend and a retired corrections officer, who is 69, were taken into custody on Tuesday night and were being questioned on Wednesday. Police said the argument began when the ex-officer, who was armed with a 9-millimeter handgun, stepped between the two friends as they had a conversation on the train. The clash turned physical and one of the younger men spit on the officer, police said.

< D-9805	-0.0036150559317320585	Scientists in New Mexico have a new theory for the origin of Earth's iron. Research suggests iron would have turned into vapour when meteorites hit the young Earth, as shown in the artist's impression above. The vapour would then have drifted up in plumes, condensed and then rained down on the surface of our planet. The research, which found iron vapourised at values 40 per cent lower than thought, was conducted with the Z machine.

The US Drug Enforcement Administration, which had Morales on its 'Most Wanted' list, had offered a $5million reward for his capture on cocaine-trafficking charges. The suspect is the brother of Miguel Angel Trevinos, who is described as the most bloodthirsty leader of Mexico's most violent organized crime group. The Zetas carved a path of brutality, bloodshed and mutilated bodies across northern Mexico during their turf battles with the rival Gulf cartel.

Police, paramedics and firefighters trampled through her home, ‘severely contaminating’ the murder scene. Muddy footprints were left on the floor, a detective touched her front door key with his bare hand and her grieving family was even allowed into the property to clean it up. Concerns were only raised two days later by a mortuary technician. Detectives are still hunting the killer two years after her brutal death.

Several other states have legalised marijuana for medicinal use or have decriminalised it. A notable feature of state-legalised retail sales of marijuana has been the popularity of edibles. The problem is that marijuana edibles – which often look like candy or cookies and are frequently potent – increase the chances that children will overdose, they say.

He grew up in Melbourne with four younger siblings and an abusive father, who once smashed his son's head through a wall.

The research, published in the journal Current Biology, was led by the University of Sao Paulo. It focused on Neonothopanus gardneri, one of the biggest and brightest of bioluminescent mushrooms.

The image was once a symbol of Clinton's funny side as the face of the Texts From Hillary meme, which she said had given her 'many LOLZ' - but fell out of favor this week.

Previous epochs began and ended due meteorite strikes, sustained volcanic eruptions and the shifting of the continents. Scientists said the 1492 arrival of Europeans in the Americas, and subsequent global trade, moved species to new continents and oceans on an unprecedented level, resulting in a global re-ordering of life on Earth.

< D-5925	-0.0034990704152733088	A pregnant woman and her seven-year-old son have been found shot dead at a home in rural Queensland alongside the body of a male relative. Three gunshots were heard coming from the home on Sunday night at around 10.30pm but police were not called to the scene until Monday evening. The man's other daughter reportedly discovered all three bodies at the home in Biddeston, in the Toowoomba Region, on Monday at around 6.45pm. Police believe the father's death is not suspicious, while his 27- year-old daughter and her son's death are being treated as suspicious.

< D-9342	-0.002572700148448348	Emile Hirsch made his first court appearance Monday on allegations that he put a studio executive in a chokehold and dragged her across a nightclub table while he was in Utah for the Sundance Film Festival. The 'Into the Wild' star declined to comment Monday outside court in Park City. His attorney Neil Kaplan says Hirsch is receiving counseling after going to rehab. Hirsch was charged last month with aggravated assault, which is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. He is also facing a misdemeanor count of intoxication.

> D-9342	-0.0025726999156177044	Emile Hirsch made his first court appearance Monday on allegations that he put a studio executive in a chokehold and dragged her across a nightclub table while he was in Utah for the Sundance Film Festival. The 'Into the Wild' star declined to comment Monday outside court in Park City. His attorney Neil Kaplan says Hirsch is receiving counseling after going to rehab. Hirsch was charged last month with aggravated assault, which is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. He is also facing a misdemeanor count of intoxication.

The 63-year-old Ireland boss has spent the last week keeping his fingers crossed over a series of injury doubts, all the while considering options to plug potential gaps in his starting line-up. Everton midfielder Darron Gibson has already returned to his club after admitting defeat in his battle against a groin problem. However, full-back Stephen Ward and winger James McClean were both able to train in Malahide on Friday.

She had accused Alexander Economou, 35, of drugging and raping her. But the allegations were dropped due to lack of evidence. Mr Economou paid for his own inquiry, assembling emails, text messages, details of phone calls and CCTV footage of them together. He then started a private prosecution against her for allegedly lying to police. The whole process is said to have cost him £200,000. Her family said they were 'astonished' the CPS decided to take her to court.

The lodger moved in to act as Ms Thomas's carer but also to fill her second bedroom. The bedroom tax limits a tenant's housing benefit if they have an unused bedroom in their property.

< D-716	-0.00786201935261488	Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress threatens to undermine bipartisan support for Israel. Netanyahu is driven not only by his concerns about Iran's nuclear threat, but also by domestic political considerations. Israel will hold its national elections just two weeks after his visit to Washington. Netanyahu has allowed his bad blood with Obama to spill over into his government's complicated relationship with the Democratic Party.

The process works by looking for two characters that commonly appear together but then generating a third letter that does not. The result is 56-bit passwords that look like English but are not, making them easy to remember but harder for hackers to guess.

In the most recent case, a woman with a 20-year history of mental illness had been charged with neglect after her five-day-old baby mysteriously died. Her defense attorney said the prosecutor assigned to the case wouldn't go forward with a plea deal to keep the woman out of prison unless she had the surgery. District Attorney Glenn Funk has banned his office from offering that option.

The higher a man's testosterone has risen during the day, the more the 'love hormone' oxytocin he tends to produce on his arrival home. The researchers also found that the increase in oxytoc in was greater for those men who were absent longer. High testosterone while hunting could be attributed to a 'winner effect' experienced by men making a kill. It could also be related to the status competition that hunting represents for traditional societies such as theTsimane.

It can cultivate a staggering 150 acres of land in a single day, which is the equivalents of 100 football pitches. The US-made tractor is controlled by satellite and works and steers with an accuracy over the ground of less than an inch. GPS steering systems are farmers’ favourite piece of modern farming technology. The cab is fitted with climate control and the seat is leather and heated.

It can cultivate a staggering 150 acres of land in a single day, which is the equivalents of 100 football pitches. The US-made tractor is controlled by satellite and works and steers with an accuracy over the ground of less than an inch. GPS steering systems are farmers’ favourite piece of modern farming technology. The cab is fitted with climate control and the seat is leather and heated. There is even a DVD player to watch while the tractor follows its pre-set path up and down fields.

John used images of his kidney from the CT scan to recreate a model, slice by slice, using layers of plaster of Paris half a millimetre thick. This allows the surgeon to complete surgery faster and more accurately.

The work involved installing 400 more feet of power and data cable, as well as two antennas. The astronauts successfully routed 364 feet on their first two excursions, on February 21 and last Wednesday. But, dramatically, right before Sunday's spacewalks, engineers spotted problems with Wilmore's suit. On Sunday morning, a pressure sensor briefly malfunctioned before he floated out. Meanwhile, Nasa said a small amount of water got into Virts' helmet once he was back in the air lock on Wednesday.

< D-9417	-0.005264211446046829	Blaze broke out at the historic Battersea Arts Centre in south London at just after 4.15pm today. Flames engulfed the roof of the Grade II listed property which later collapsed into the theatre building which was surrounded by scaffolding. London Fire Brigade had twelve engines and more than 80 firefighters battling the fire at the height of the inferno. By midnight on Friday, the fire service had scaled back the effort to four fire engines and around thirty firefighters.

London Fire Brigade had twelve engines and more than 80 firefighters battling the fire at the height of the inferno. By midnight on Friday, the fire service had scaled back the effort to four fire engines and around thirty firefighters.

When she regained consciousness, she found Smith slashing his wrists. But she had no memory of the assault and feared he would escape justice. She hired a hypnotherapist who helped her piece together the details of the attack. Police then used her evidence in court to convince a jury to convict him of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm with intent and criminal damage. Smith was today jailed for ten years at Warwick Crown Court.

< D-13239	-0.0029709856025874615	Nick Gordon, the troubled fiancé of Bobby Kristina Brown, has defended himself against allegations that Whitney Houston’s daughter was the victim of foul play.

I want to let all you guys know I did everything possible in the world to protect them’ Gordon's impassioned assertion was made during a dramatic intervention staged by Dr Phil last week and due to air today. Weeping and wailing and at times incoherent, Gordon had believed that he was to be interviewed by DrPhil.

She was on the phone to her husband when a suspicious man appeared. Her husband then heard her screaming before the line went dead. Police have released CCTV footage of a woman walking alone just minutes before she was fatally stabbed to death. The CCTV footage doesn't appear to show anyone following the victim.

< D-7486	-0.005041581578552723	English speakers can take five times as long to describe an odour than a colour. But native speakers from the Jahai tribe in Perak, Malaysia, described odours far more consistently and in less time than they can a colour, say scientists. The Jahai have at least 12 specific abstract words that relate to smells while the Maniq, a tribe of hunter gatherers in southern Thailand, have 15. The findings suggest English speakers have lost the ability to accurately describe smells.

< D-6738	-0.0031760158017277718	The intact organ was discovered inside a decapitated skull in York seven years ago. Tests have revealed that the brain and other remains are 2,600 years old and have survived because the head was buried in a sealed clay pit devoid of oxygen, soon after its owner’s death. As there was no new oxygen in the brain, and no movement, it was protected and preserved. While over time, the skin, hair and flesh of the skull rotted away, the fats and proteins of the brain tissue linked together to form a mass of large complex molecules. Experts can't be certain but think that the delicate brain tissue survived the ravages of time.

< D-12680	-0.003254764014855027	Much of the start of the world's most famous sled dog race is covered in barren gravel, forcing Iditarod organizers to move the start further north where there is snow and ice. A weather pattern that buried the eastern U.S. in snow has left Alaska fairly warm and relatively snow-free this winter, especially south of the Alaska Range. The official start two days later has been moved 225 miles (360 kilometers) north, over the Alaska range, to Fairbanks to avoid the area that left many mushers bruised and bloodied last year.

> D-12680	-0.0032547637820243835	Much of the start of the world's most famous sled dog race is covered in barren gravel, forcing Iditarod organizers to move the start further north where there is snow and ice. A weather pattern that buried the eastern U.S. in snow has left Alaska fairly warm and relatively snow-free this winter, especially south of the Alaska Range. The official start two days later has been moved 225 miles (360 kilometers) north, over the Alaska range, to Fairbanks to avoid the area that left many mushers bruised and bloodied last year.

A fan was arrested after allegedly racially abusing Reading's Garath McCleary, while one home fan invaded the pitch and goaded Bradford supporters. There was also a mass pitch invasion by home fans after the final whistle and a flare was hurled into the South Stand. Thames Valley Police confirmed that an 18-year-old man from Bradford had been arrested and cautioned for carrying a flare.

< D-11103	-0.0035486165434122086	Researchers at the University of California Berkeley have found the best way to fold a variety of clothes into neat rectangles. They use a principal that they have called the 'g-fold' - where clothing is laid out on a flat surface and gravity is used to help assist the folding of clothing. For a jumper, for example, they suggest folding the sleeves in half first at the elbow and then folding them in at the shoulders. Folding a pair of trousers or jeans requires just the simplest of folds according to the research. Their findings are intended to help a new generation of robots take on some of our more monotonous household chores.

Deborah Sena was offered the same deal, but her attorney said she was a victim and her husband made her take part.

MPs said that Northern Ireland was suffering in terms of jobs, growth and connectivity as aviation taxes were higher than in the Republic of Ireland. Scottish Government wants to reduce APD by 50 per cent in the next term of the Scottish Parliament and eventually get rid of it altogether.

< D-10952	-0.0037339043337851763	The New York Times reported on Monday that Hillary Clinton's aides sometimes used their personal email accounts to communicate with her through her own private account. Clinton has been dogged by allegations that she purposely hid incriminating emails from the State Department – and from public records requesters – by keeping all her emails on a private server. The emails do not prove the former secretary of state ordered a 'stand down,' stopping U.S. forces from responding to the Benghazi attack or participated in a related cover-up, the newspaper reported. But they do raise new questions about how much of Clinton's correspondence has been lost to history.

< D-8722	-0.004707685671746731	Cats with square faces are often keen to please their owners. 'Square cats tend to be affectionate and love to snuggle and give head-butts,' said cat behaviourist, Arden Moore. Cats with round faces also have flatter features, large eyes, circular heads, and rounded bodies.

The 43-year-old suffered a collapsed lung and seven broken ribs and was also left unconscious on the ground following the dramatic incident. But five months after the event, Avon and Somerset police said no charges would be brought against Mark Doggrell, who had been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. CPS said there was 'insufficient evidence that the incident could have been foreseen' But the organisation is now reviewing the footage after 12,000 people signed a petition urging the organisation to reconsider charging the rider.

Parents are threatening to stop paying their dues of $4,300 because their children aren't getting the benefit of May-treanor's tutelage, as they feel they were promised.

> D-4955	-0.00421326095238328	Misty May-Treanor has reportedly fallen out with longtime trainer Mike Rangel, just six months after he founded a new sports center in her name. Parents are threatening to stop paying their dues of $4,300 because their children aren't getting the benefit of May-treanor's tutelage, as they feel they were promised. In a new report by the OC Register, Rangel said he and May- treanor split over the simple issue of sponsorship. Rangel agreed to let Asics sponsor the club, while 37-year-old May- Treanor remains a spokesman for competitor Nike.

For 11 years, he concocted a false story about his wife's whereabouts. But, after being investigated for a separate insurance scam, he was convicted of her murder in 1996, despite Ms Packman's body never being found. Now daughter Samantha Gillingham, 46, is begging for her depraved father to reveal the whereabouts of her mother's body, as the 30th anniversary of her disappearance approaches.

< D-9441	-0.0044908770360052586	Scientists have reported multiple cases of cape fur seals attacking blue sharks and eating their guts off the coast of South Africa. The behaviour has left marine biologists baffled as to why the seals have turned to attacking the torpedo-shaped sharks. The blue sharks are around the same size as the seals and it is thought to be the first time a seal has been seen preying on such a large predator.

I hope that the delay is because Hamilton is seeking a move to Ferrari. He hopes to have emulated his hero Ayrton Senna in winning three world titles. Sebastian Vettel won four consecutive world championships as Red Bull.

They were given until yesterday to vacate their illegal camp – dubbed the Jungle – or face arrest. Many have simply upped sticks and moved half a mile along the coast to a new camp, much to the horror of local residents. French police sources said they would use force to remove any remaining migrants today.

The mammoth task saw the digger gradually heaved to ground level at a rate of four to five inches a minute, with the help of seven miles of cable.

Jackson is the longest-serving wrongfully convicted prisoner and was awarded $1million on Thursday as a down payment. The figure is computed from the state's base rate for wrongful conviction compensation, which stands at $40,330 per year in jail. Jackson will also receive an undetermined sum of money to account for the wages he lost while in prison, according to his attorney Michele Berry.

Durst was heard to mumble to himself 'killed them all, of course' in an unguarded moment off camera featured at the end of the final episode of HBO's The Jinx. He was arrested by police in New Orleans just hours before the show was broadcast and has since been charged with murder in the December 2000 shooting death of Susan Berman. There is speculation that Durst's explosive comments could be used against him in court, but attorney Dick DeGuerin said they prove nothing.

John Bilardi is paralysed with an unbearable sense of guilt as he tries to make any sense of what would possess his son, now known as Jihadi Jake. The 18-year-old converted to Muslim and regularly attended mosques but his new lifestyle choice did not end there as he flew to the Middle East in December which ultimately cost him his life in a failed suicide mission in Iraq last week. Jake's father described his son as an 'extremely shy' loner who felt alienated from his family and even expressed in one of his blogs that he felt unsafe with his siblings.

Eight of the stopped clocks are on council-owned buildings, such as the Guildhall, but the remaining eight are on private buildings. Cash-strapped Swansea council believes private clocks should be cared for by their owners, including church authorities. It wants to use an electric winding system to control the clocks on the private buildings but is yet to have it installed.

He first noticed about half of his 600 to 700 'Easter Egger' hens were missing after returning to work following a brief illness. It came just days after he noticed the coop was wide open and that some of the birds were outside, so he told his sons, aged 11 and 13, to make sure they secured the door behind them. Easter Eggers are a mix of different breeds. Their eggs may be blue, green, pink, brown, olive or cream.

More than 2,200 explosive charges ripped through the redundant building, tearing it to the ground. The dramatic collapse came after a five-minute warning siren had sounded out across the four-acre site. The £5m operation had also seen residents evacuated from more than 400 nearby homes, as a precaution. The 574ft long, three-floor building was built in 1976 and has dominated the Northampton skyline for almost 40 years.

He was only 12 when he found fame thanks to the JK Rowling books being turned into films. When he started going on the publicity trail to promote the films, he noticed a certain fan was always there. Her name was Tina Davies and she would be waiting for him outside hotels, film premieres and events he attended desperate for a glimpse of the star and hopefully a picture or autograph.

The fighter jet is the centerpiece of the British Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier-based fleet, and dozens have already been ordered. Though it's mandated that an F- 35B jet, designed by Lockheed Martin, hold eight SDB IIs in the bay, only four reportedly fit. The problem will not affect the Royal Navy, however, as its aircraft are to carry different weapons.

< D-6470	-0.0029860767535865307	California company Pebble has broken the all-time Kickstarter record. They raised more than £9.7 million in just a week - with 23 days still to go. So far more than 60,000 people have backed the new smartwatch. But Pebble has been criticised for still using Kickstarter to raise funds. The new Time smartwatch comes with a colour e-paper screen. It is Pebble's third product but the first to feature a colour screen. The Time will have a retail price of £129 ($199) once the campaign ends.

Jones is not representing the two students, Parker Rice and Levi Pettit. He said that he hopes to reach a 'non-legal' resolution with the university, which he indicated acted hastily when it closed down the frat house on Monday.

Jones is not representing the two students, Parker Rice and Levi Pettit. He said that he hopes to reach a 'non-legal' resolution with the university, which he indicated acted hastily when it closed down the frat house on Monday. He added that he also wants to ensure the students - some of whom have received death threats - are granted their right to due process.

It is the same location 13-year-old Doreen O'Sullivan drowned in 1915. Social media users are claiming that the white shape at the back of the image, circled, shows a ghostly face. Ms Davison claims her daughter's leg was grabbed by something in the water.

Now Margaret enjoys the gym and exercise classes with her friends at the Thomas Holt Sans Souci Gardens aged care facility, in Sydney. A few years earlier Margaret had broken her pelvis in three places, at the age of 93, and needed to be rehabilitated.

Lockyer was brandishing a 10cms long knife when he grabbed her. He told her: 'I will kill you if you don't do what I want you to do' The woman then told Lockyer she would do whatever he wanted, which appeared to take him by surprise and gave her the chance to slip free from his grasp and jump into the canal. The victim described her attacker as looking like an actor from BBC drama The Tudors.

< D-12989	-0.00286984839476645	Joseph Anthony Mitchell, 50, was found not guilty of first-degree murder and attempted murder on Wednesday. His ex-wife, Christine Perolini, was so stunned by the ruling that she hyperventilated and had to be wheeled out on a stretcher. Mitchell testified that he was in financial distress and had not been sleeping well around the time of 4-year-old Blake Mitchell's death in September 2010. Prosecutors said those financial difficulties drove Mitchell to strangle the toddler and try to kill his two older children. But a defense expert said Mitchell's stress and lack of sleep likely resulted in 'non-REM parasomnia,' a sleep disorder whose sufferers can perform random acts unconsciously.

< D-8748	-0.003100429428741336	Astronomers have found nine new dwarf galaxies in orbit around the Milky Way. They are the first to be discovered orbiting our galaxy in more than a decade. Dwarf galaxies are the smallest galaxy structures in the universe, and can contain as few as 5,000 stars - whereas our galaxy has around 200 billion. The newly discovered objects are each a billion times dimmer than our galaxy, and a million times less massive. This makes them incredibly difficult to find, even in our galactic neighbourhood. Importantly, though, they are thought to contain 99 per cent dark matter and just one per cent observable matter. This means they could be useful to test cosmological theories of dark matter.

< D-9336	-0.00556988874450326	Jake Bilardi, 18, is said to have blown himself up in a suicide bomb attack. The Melbourne teen travelled to the Iraqi city of Ramadi last year. Bilardi's passport was cancelled in October last year, once authorities were made aware of his activities in the Middle East. An image of Bilardi sitting in front of an IS flag was posted to Twitter linking him to 13 suicide car bomb attacks on Iraqi army and security positions. Australian authorities have yet to confirm the 18-year-old died.

His autobiography about his own ordeal was turned into the 2013 film The Railway Man, starring Colin Firth. The book is an account of a survey carried out to assess the feasibility of laying tracks from China to Rangoon in 1888. It was found in his library along with hundreds of black-and-white photos and postcards showing the construction of the Gold Coast Railway in West Africa. The snaps had been lovingly compiled into two albums by the huge railway enthusiast.

His autobiography about his own ordeal was turned into the 2013 film The Railway Man, starring Colin Firth. The book is an account of a survey carried out to assess the feasibility of laying tracks from China to Rangoon in 1888. It was found in his library along with hundreds of black-and-white photos and postcards showing the construction of the Gold Coast Railway in West Africa. The snaps had been lovingly compiled into two albums by the huge railway enthusiast.

< D-5649	-0.005693536251783371	Vince Vaughn and Lady Gaga attended the Special Olympics Polar Plunge in Chicago on Sunday, when the water was right around the freezing point. The event raises money for athletes with special needs by plunging into Lake Michigan. The plunge came at the end of a February that had seen cold records shattered across much of the US. Chicago tied a 140-year-old record for its coldest February with an average temperature of 14.6 degrees. The Windy City also received a combined 27 inches of snow in February, the city's third highest level ever.

> D-5649	-0.005693535786122084	Vince Vaughn and Lady Gaga attended the Special Olympics Polar Plunge in Chicago on Sunday, when the water was right around the freezing point. The event raises money for athletes with special needs by plunging into Lake Michigan. The plunge came at the end of a February that had seen cold records shattered across much of the US. Chicago tied a 140-year-old record for its coldest February with an average temperature of 14.6 degrees. The Windy City also received a combined 27 inches of snow in February, the city's third highest level ever.

The footage that was shared on Monday shows his former girlfriend Darci Ives and her boyfriend Louis Yager, who live together in Tampa, chastising and hitting Yager's two children and Shelby. Ives' sister reportedly shot the disturbing footage and a friend made one compilation of the several videos that show the children. Foster is currently raising money to pay for legal and travel fees so that he can bring Shelby to New York with him.

The World Health Organization recommends that adults of normal body mass index only eat 25g (six teaspoons) of sugar in total per day. Dr Kieron Rooney said it is ‘disingenuous, duplicitous and highly inappropriate’ for Coke products to be marketed as healthy.

< D-10323	-0.002740423893555999	Lisa Wilkinson has laughed off the controversy surrounding Natarsha Belling's jacket, saying she has the same item in her wardrobe. The jacket worn by Belling, complete with its phallic-shaped neckline, created an online frenzy after the Network 10 presenter appeared on-air wearing it. Wilkinson, apparently not put-off by the controversy, said she plans to wear her jacket tomorrow and called on other TV hosts to do the same. 'The #p***sjacket! REALLY? Calling all TVhosts who have this jacket to wear it on air tomorrow. I will! #geez,' Wilkinson tweeted.

Mesa Detective Esteban Flores said victims were shot Wednesday morning at four locations, including a restaurant and a hotel. The suspect has not yet been named, but Detective Flores described him as a bald, white man in his 40s with tattoos on his neck and face. He was last seen wearing a black shirt and black shorts.

The children, Stoni Ann Blair and Stephen Gage Berry died, are believed to have been 13 and 9, respectively, when they died. Blair allegedly killed her son two years ago and then her daughter in 2014 after learning of the abuse. Police sources told The Detroit News earlier this week that Blair confessed to killing the two, after reportedly discovering they had been molesting a younger relative. Blair has been charged with five counts of first-degree child abuse, one of which could land her in prison for life.

But his lawyers are arguing that mental illness and an intellectual disability, which is the result of a traumatic brain injury, make the 74-year-old ineligible for execution. Their last-ditch effort to save his life comes after the Missouri Supreme Court refused to halt the execution over the same claims. Doctors were forced to remove 20 per cent of his frontal lobe, the area of the brain that controls decision making and emotions, after an accident in 1972.

She was stabbed in the stomach by the stranger who posted the ad, with her baby forcibly removed from her womb. Local law enforcement officers Billy Sawyer and Phil Piotrowski were first on the scene and describe finding Wilkins weak and in a state of shock. Wilkins was so shocked when she arrived at Longmont United Hospital that she still thought she was pregnant, sources say. The suspect, Dynel Lane, 34, was arrested presenting the abducted child as her own in hospital, and is facing charges of first-degree attempted murder.

Inside the shoe's sole is a Bluetooth receiver that connects the displays to a smartphone app. Patterns including polka dots, animal stripes and flowers can then be selected and 'sent' to the displays on the shoes. The shoe also has physical customisation options. On the top of the toe and back of the heel are anchors, to which the wearer can attach accessories - a flower or bow on the toe, for example.

The toddler, who was possibly going to be released this week, remains in hospital as she recovers from the stomach flu. Phuoc and her twin sister Binh, adopted from Vietnam, were both in need of liver transplants because they suffer from Alagille syndrome, a genetic condition. Last month, their father Michael Wagner was able to give a portion of his liver to her, which left him with an impossible decision. The girls mother, Johanne, said that they are still waiting on a living donor for Binh as they continue to be patient.

School friends of Ms Gibson now query whether the health guru invented stories 'to get sympathy' and warned people against vaccination.

The child's stepmother, Jessica Mae Hardin, told the 911 operator the girl had a seizure. Garrard's lawyers haven't denied that the girl ran before her collapse, but the defense said the woman had no intention of harming her granddaughter. A neighbor testified that Savannah was crying and begging to stop before she collapsed. The girl died in a hospital three days later.

Sami, who did not wish to give his last name, had been exchanging text messages with the convicted drug smuggler up until late Tuesday night. It comes as it is revealed Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop made a desperate plea to Jakarta officials to swap Chan and Myuran Sukuraman for three Indonesian drug offenders being held in Australia. Ms Bishop proposed the deal in a 'very tense' phone call with Indonesian foreign affairs minister Retno Marsudi. But the suggestion, which was made during a 30-minute conversation, was not accepted according to sources.

She used a baby sling to cover herself and the child for privacy, but was told to remove it by Virgin Australia staff. The mother claims staff did not explain why covering her child’s head with a sling was a hazard. Ms Rutgers was allowed to go without charge, but found herself stranded with her baby at Gold Coast airport. Virgin Australia has refused to compensate her for the cost of her hotel or for her taxis.

The 40-year-old stopped working as a hooker in 2003 after Richard Pratt promised her he would look after her and her two children. Ms Ashton launched an appeal against the 2012 decision to reject her bid for part of the cardboard king's estate. She said Mr Pratt had promised to set up two trust funds, worth $2.5 million each, for her two kids and pay her $500,000 as a 'retainer' to stop working as an escort and become his mistress. Mr Pratt died in 2009.

Nealon and three friends went to look for the possible shooter, police said at a press conference on Friday. A witness told police that when they saw the victim and his family outside their apartment block, Nealon raised his gun and fired. He voluntarily spoke to police and admitted he had been at the scene of the shooting, but he blamed another member of the group for firing the shots.

Evans visited a school in Ballarat, Victoria, where he taught children in years five and six how to cook paleo recipes. His school visit comes as it was claimed negative comments about his diet are being deleted from his official Facebook page. On Wednesday, it was announced that the release of Evan's paleo cookbook for children had been delayed due to grave concerns about the nutritional value of recipes in the book. The Public Health Association of Australia said that one of the recipes had the potential to stunt the growth of babies.

< D-8146	-0.004128949251025915	Shelly Sterling testified against V. Stiviano in the nonjury trial in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday. 'She defrauded him and I feel that she is not entitled to any of these gifts or whatever they call them,' she said. Donald Sterling told a judge on Wednesday that V.Stiviano befriended a Hispanic bank employee in order to get her name illegally added to a $1 million check. The chief financial officer of Sterling's real estate company testified that it appeared his boss was cutting checks that made it hard to trace where they went.

> D-8146	-0.004128948785364628	Shelly Sterling testified against V. Stiviano in the nonjury trial in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday. 'She defrauded him and I feel that she is not entitled to any of these gifts or whatever they call them,' she said. Donald Sterling told a judge on Wednesday that V.Stiviano befriended a Hispanic bank employee in order to get her name illegally added to a $1 million check. The chief financial officer of Sterling's real estate company testified that it appeared his boss was cutting checks that made it hard to trace where they went. Sterling said he only intended to loan a Ferrari and a Bentley to Stivano, but he put them under her name.

Police say wife Debrah Lee Charatan, 58, allegedly tried to help Durst flee to Cuba before his recent arrest.

Police are going over Charatan's financial records to look for money transfers or other incriminating evidence. 'The wife is definitely in play,' a police source said.

His family and friends let out exclamations when the verdict was handed down. Speaking outside court on Wednesday Mr Huxly's ex-girlfriend Jessica Hall said his 'life had been stolen by a worthless psychopath' The crown relied on a string of circumstantial evidence, which crown prosecutor Peter McGrath SC told the jury would leave them to infer only one thing.

Speaking outside court on Wednesday Mr Huxly's ex-girlfriend Jessica Hall said his 'life had been stolen by a worthless psychopath' The crown relied on a string of circumstantial evidence, which crown prosecutor Peter McGrath SC told the jury would leave them to infer only one thing.

The holdout juror did not speak to the media on Thursday. But other jurors said they thought Arias lacked remorse and that her attorneys had presented an inaccurate portrait of Mr Alexander. The jurors apologized to the Alexander family for the deadlock and said they felt Arias was trying to manipulate the jury.
