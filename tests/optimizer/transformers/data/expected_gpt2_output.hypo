Marseille, France -LRB- CNN -RRB- The French prosecutor leading an investigation into the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 insisted Wednesday that he was not aware of any video footage from on board the plane. Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin told CNN that `` so far no videos were used in the crash investigation. '' He added, `` A person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators. '' Robin's comments follow claims by two magazines, German daily Bild and French Paris Match, of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board Germanwings Flight 9525 as it crashed into the French Alps. All 150 on board were killed. Paris Match and Bild reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site. The two publications described the supposed video, but did not post it on their websites. The publications said that they watched the video, which was found by a source close to the investigation. `` One can hear cries of ` My God'in several languages, '' Paris Match reported. `` Metallic banging can also be heard more than three times, perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object. Towards the end, after a heavy shake, stronger than the others, the pilot can be heard saying, ` I can't open the door with my hands on the ground''' Bild reported. The French newspaper Le Monde quoted Robin as saying that he had not seen any video of the crash. Robin said that he did not know whether the video had been used in any way in the investigation or whether it had been edited out of the video. He added that he would not comment further on the matter until the investigation is complete. Robin also said that the investigators had not been able to find any evidence to support the claim that the crash was a terrorist attack. He said that there was no evidence to suggest that the plane had been hijacked or that it had crashed on its way to the French capital. Robin added that the investigation had not yet concluded whether the plane was hijacked or not, but that it was possible that it might have been hijacked and that it may have crashed in the Alps. Robin told reporters that he believed
-LRB- CNN -RRB- The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday, a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague, in the Netherlands, where the court is based. The Palestinians signed the ICC's founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed `` in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014. '' Later that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians'efforts to join the body. But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, speaking at Wednesday's ceremony, said it was a move toward greater justice. `` As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice, '' he said, according to an ICC news release. `` Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of peace and security in the Middle East and beyond, and to the end of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem as well as the illegal settlement of Palestinian land in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- Governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism -- real or perceived -- to advance executions, Amnesty International alleges in its annual report on the death penalty. `` The dark trend of governments using the death penalty in a futile attempt to tackle real or imaginary threats to state security and public safety was stark last year, '' said Salil Shetty, Amnesty's Secretary General in a release. `` It is shameful that so many states around the world are essentially playing with people's lives -- putting people to death for ` terrorism'or to quell internal instability on the ill-conceived premise of deterrence. '' The report, `` Death Sentences and Executions 2014, '' cites the example of Pakistan lifting a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in Peshawar in December. China is also mentioned, as having used the death penalty as a tool in its `` Strike Hard '' campaign against terrorism in the restive far-western province of Xinjiang. The annual report catalogs the use of state-sanctioned killing as a punitive measure across the globe, and this year's edition contains some mixed findings. On one hand, the number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost a third in the past decade, while in the United States the number has gone up by more than a third. On the other hand, there is little evidence to suggest that executions are being used as a means of deterring or deterring others from committing acts of terrorism. In fact, the United Nations estimates that there are more than 1.5 million people in the world who have been executed for terrorism-related crimes in the last five years. In addition, the U.S. State Department estimates that more than half of all executions are carried out by state-sponsored terrorists, and that the United Kingdom has executed more people than any other country in recent years.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>
-LRB- CNN -RRB- On May 28, 2014, some 7,000 people gathered in a stadium in China's northwestern Xinjiang region. But they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event. Instead, the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits. Armed soldiers guarded the exits. In the patently unfair, open air trial that followed, 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed. Three were sentenced to death. The public mass sentencing was part a China's `` Strike Hard '' campaign against unrest in Xinjiang, a campaign the government claims was launched to combat `` terrorism '' and `` separatism. '' But it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided, and often cynical, attempt to tackle crime and terrorism. Today, Amnesty International releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide. Much of it makes for grim reading. In Pakistan, the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar in December. More than 60 people have been put to death since, and the number of people executed in Pakistan is expected to rise in the coming years. The United Nations estimates that more than 1 million people in Pakistan will be executed in the next five years, and more than 2.5 million will be killed by the end of the year. In China, the Chinese government has used the death sentence as a means of punishing those who commit crimes against humanity, and has used it as a way to punish those who do not commit crimes. The government has also used it to punish people who commit acts of violence against the state, such as the murder of a police officer and the rape of a young woman. The Chinese government's use of death sentences has been widely criticized in the United States, where it has been used as a tool of political repression and as a weapon of mass murder. The death penalty has also been used in China as a form of punishment for crimes committed in the name of national security, as well as for
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Seventy years ago, Anne Frank died of typhus in a Nazi concentration camp at the age of 15. Just two weeks after her supposed death on March 31, 1945, the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp where she had been imprisoned was liberated -- timing that showed how close the Jewish diarist had been to surviving the Holocaust. But new research released by the Anne Frank House shows that Anne and her older sister, Margot Frank, died at least a month earlier than previously thought. Researchers re-examined archives of the Red Cross, the International Training Service and the Bergen-Belsen Memorial, along with testimonies of survivors. They concluded that Anne and Margot probably did not survive to March 1945 -- contradicting the date of death which had previously been determined by Dutch authorities. In 1944, Anne and seven others hiding in the Amsterdam secret annex were arrested and sent to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. Anne Frank's final entry. That same year, Anne and Margot were separated from their mother and sent away to work as slave labor at the Bergen-Belsen camp in Germany. Days at the camp were filled with terror and dread, witnesses said. The sisters stayed in a section of the camp where they were forced to work for hours on end. They were beaten and starved to death. In 1945, they were sent back to the concentration camp to live with their families. In 1946, the sisters were finally reunited with their older sister, Margot, who had been living with them at the time of her death. The next year, they moved to a new location in the Netherlands, where they lived with their parents and siblings until they were able to return to the United States. In 1947, the family moved back to their new home in New York City, where the sisters lived with relatives and friends until they died. In 1948, the sister and sister-in-law were finally released from the concentration camps. In 1949, the two sisters were reunited with the older sister who had lived with them for years. In 1950, the younger sister was reunited with her older brother, who was still living with the sisters. In 1951,
-LRB- CNN -RRB- A Duke student has admitted to hanging a noose made of rope from a tree near a student union, university officials said Thursday. The prestigious private school didn't identify the student, citing federal privacy laws. In a news release, it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review. The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said. Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved. Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well. Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting `` We are not afraid. We stand together, '' after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media. At a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel, close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m., hundreds of people gathered. `` You came here for the reason that you want to say with me, ` This is no Duke we will accept. This is no Duke we want. This is not the Duke we're here to experience. And this is not the Duke we're here to create,''' Duke President Richard Brodhead told the crowd. '' We are here to stand together. We will not let this happen to us, '' he said. The noose, which had been hanging from the tree for more than a week, was removed from the building and placed in a storage locker at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, according to the university's website. It was not immediately clear if the student had been suspended or expelled from the school or if he would be allowed to return to the school. The student has not been charged with a crime, according to a statement from the university.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- The Rev. Robert H. Schuller, California televangelist and founder of the television ministry `` Hour of Power, '' died Thursday, according to his family. He was 88 years old. Schuller, also the founder of Crystal Cathedral megachurch, had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer in August 2013, a release from `` Hour of Power '' said. `` My father-in-law passed away peacefully early this morning. He was a great Dad and a great man of God, '' said Schuller's daughter-in-law, Donna Schuller, in a Twitter message. Schuller's life followed an almost Shakespearean arc. He was born in a Iowa farmhouse without running water and longed to preach from his earliest days. In his autobiography, `` Prayer : My Soul's Adventure with God, '' he described standing alone by a river and picturing himself delivering sermons to a rapt congregation. After attending a Hope College and Western Theological Seminary in Michigan, he met his wife of more than 60 years, Arvella, while preaching at her church -LRB- she was the organist -RRB-. With their young family in tow, he and his wife moved to Los Angeles, where they lived with their three children and their mother. He was married to his first wife, Mary Ann, and they had three children. The Schullers had two sons and two daughters. The family moved to California from New York City in the early 1960s and moved to San Francisco in the late 1970s. They had two daughters and two sons. In the early 1980s, the family moved back to California to live with their mother and their two children. They moved to New York in the mid-1980s and stayed in California for a few years before moving back to the United States. In 1986, they moved back home to California and moved into their new home in San Francisco, where the family lived for a couple of years. In 1987, the Schulls moved back into their old home in Los Angeles and moved back in with their children. In 1988, they relocated
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Never mind cats having nine lives. A stray pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car, apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive. That's according to Washington State University, where the dog -- a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix now named Theia -- has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Four days after her apparent death, the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm, dirt-covered and emaciated, where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help. She was taken in by Moses Lake, Washington, resident Sara Mellado. `` Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving, '' Mellado said, according to WSU News. `` She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life. '' Theia is only one year old but the dog's brush with death did not leave her unscathed. She suffered a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe. The veterinary hospital said the dog's death was a tragic accident, and that it will continue to care for the dog until she is able to return to her home state of Washington. The hospital said in a statement that the dog is expected to be euthanized by the end of the week.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>
-LRB- CNN -RRB- If you've been following the news lately, there are certain things you doubtless know about Mohammad Javad Zarif. He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. `` Long live Zarif, '' crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is `` polished '' and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, `` jovial. '' An Internet search for `` Mohammad Javad Zarif '' and `` jovial '' yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six :. In September 2013, Zarif tweeted `` Happy Rosh Hashanah, '' referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), to call for a boycott of Iran's nuclear program. Zarif, who was born in Iran, has been a vocal critic of the United States and its allies in the Middle East, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Turkey, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates. He also has been critical of the U.N. Security Council's decision to impose sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program, which he has called a violation of international law. Zarif has also criticized the United Nations Security Council for failing to act on a resolution condemning Iran's ballistic missile program, a move that has been condemned by many in Congress. In December 2013, he said that the United Nation's Security Council had failed to act because it did not have the authority to sanction Iran for its ballistic missile programs. In January 2014, he called for the United State to withdraw from the nuclear deal with Iran. Zar
-LRB- CNN -RRB- For the first time in eight years, a TV legend returned to doing what he does best. Contestants told to `` come on down! '' on the April 1 edition of `` The Price Is Right '' encountered not host Drew Carey but another familiar face in charge of the proceedings. Instead, there was Bob Barker, who hosted the TV game show for 35 years before stepping down in 2007. Looking spry at 91, Barker handled the first price-guessing game of the show, the classic `` Lucky Seven, '' before turning hosting duties over to Carey, who finished up.

But all that changed Thursday when Trey asked Ellie to be his prom date. Trey -- a star on Eastern High School's basketball team in Louisville, Kentucky, who's headed to play college ball next year at Ball State -- was originally going to take his girlfriend to Eastern's prom. So why is he taking Ellie instead? `` She's great... she listens and she's easy to talk to '' he said. Trey made the prom-posal -LRB- yes, that's what they are calling invites to prom these days -RRB- in the gym during Ellie's P.E. class. Trina Helson, a teacher at Eastern, alerted the school's newspaper staff to the prom-posal and posted photos of Trey and Ellie on Twitter that have gone viral. She wasn't surpristed by Trey's actions. `` That's the kind of person Trey is, '' she said. To help make sure she said yes, Trey entered the gym armed with flowers and a poster that read, ``I love you, Trey. I love you too, Ellie.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- Michele Bachmann is comparing President Obama to the co-pilot of the doomed Germanwings flight. `` With his Iran deal, Barack Obama is for the 300 million souls of the United States what Andreas Lubitz was for the 150 souls on the German Wings flight - a deranged pilot flying his entire nation into the rocks, '' the Minnesota Republican and former representative wrote in a Facebook comment posted March 31. `` After the fact, among the smoldering remains of American cities, the shocked survivors will ask, why did he do it? '' Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525, is accused by authorities of deliberately crashing the plane in the French Alps. He died in the crash along with 149 other crew and passengers. The motive of the March 24 crash is under investigation, though investigators are looking in to whether Lubitz feared a medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot's license. Many comments posted on her Facebook page blasted the former representative. Melissa Coca wrote, `` Comparing this tragedy to anything is moronic and despicable. '' Michael J Pristash wrote, `` Your allusion is so inappropriate and divisive, not to mention disrespectful on so many levels. Shame on you... You are a disgrace to your country and your country's people. You should be ashamed of yourself and ashamed of what you have done to our country and our country's citizens. You are an embarrassment to the American people and to the world. You have no place in this country and you have no right to be here. You must be held accountable for your actions and you must be punished for what you did to our nation and our nation's people. You should not be allowed to be a part of this country. You cannot be part of the American government and you cannot be a member of this government. You can't be a citizen of this nation and you can't have a voice in this nation. It is time for you to stand up for what is right and what is not right. We must not allow this to happen to our children and our children's children. We cannot let this happen to us and we must not let this
Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- It's more than just one state's internal problem. The historic California drought hurts the rest of the union, too. That's because California is a breadbasket to the nation, growing more than a third of its vegetables and nearly two-thirds of its fruits and nuts. Here's why we should heed the ongoing drought in the most populous state, a slowly expanding natural disaster now in its fourth year that this week prompted Gov. Jerry Brown to announce a mandatory 25 % cutback in water consumption in all cities. In 2014, one expert predicted consumers would pay more for some groceries because of the California drought. He was often right, according to statistics gathered by Timothy Richards, agribusiness professor at Arizona State University. Prices rose last year for these items on your kitchen table :. • Berries rose in price by about 80 cents per clamshell to $ 3.88. • Broccoli by 11 cents per pound to $ 1.89. • Grapes by 64 cents a pound to $ 3.06. • Melons by 24 cents a pound to $ 1.23. • Packaged salad by 23 cents a bag to $ 2.91. • Peppers by 12 cents a lb to $ 4.99. • Tomato by 12.5 cents a kg to $ 5.49. • Spinach by 11.25 cents a kilo to $ 6.50. • Cauliflower by 11 cent to $ 7.50, • Cucumbers by 12 cent a pound or more to $ 8.50 and • Cabbage by 10 cent a kg or less to $ 9.00. • Beans by 12% to $ 10.00 and • Beans and peas by 12%. • Beans, peas, peas and peas are all grown in California. They are grown in large quantities in many parts of the country, and they are sold in many grocery stores. In California, beans and peas cost $1.50 to $2.50 per pound, and peas and beans cost $3.00 to $4.00 per pound. In other words, if you want to buy beans or peas
-LRB- CNN -RRB- As goes Walmart, so goes the nation? Everyone from Apple CEO Tim Cook to the head of the NCAA slammed religious freedom laws being considered in several states this week, warning that they would open the door to discrimination against gay and lesbian customers. But it was the opposition from Walmart, the ubiquitous retailer that dots the American landscape, that perhaps resonated most deeply, providing the latest evidence of growing support for gay rights in the heartland. Walmart's staunch criticism of a religious freedom law in its home state of Arkansas came after the company said in February it would boost pay for about 500,000 workers well above the federal minimum wage. Taken together, the company is emerging as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on hot-button political issues that divide conservatives and liberals. And some prominent Republicans are urging the party to take notice. Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who famously called on the GOP to `` be the party of Sam's Club, not just the country club, '' told CNN that Walmart's actions `` foreshadow where the Republican Party will need to move. '' `` The Republican Party will have to better stand for '' ideas on helping the middle class, said Pawlenty, the head of the state's Republican Party and a member of the House Appropriations Committee. He added that the company's decision to support a law that would require employers to offer same-sex marriage to their employees was an example of how the party should move forward on issues that are important to the American middle class.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- Five Americans who were monitored for three weeks at an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital after being exposed to Ebola in West Africa have been released, a Nebraska Medicine spokesman said in an email Wednesday. One of the five had a heart-related issue on Saturday and has been discharged but hasn't left the area, Taylor Wilson wrote. The others have already gone home. They were exposed to Ebola in Sierra Leone in March, but none developed the deadly virus. They are clinicians for Partners in Health, a Boston-based aid group. They all had contact with a colleague who was diagnosed with the disease and is being treated at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. As of Monday, that health care worker is in fair condition. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has said the last of 17 patients who were being monitored are expected to be released by Thursday. More than 10,000 people have died in a West African epidemic of Ebola that dates to December 2013, according to the World Health Organization. Almost all the deaths have been in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>This is the second in a two-part series on the history of the United States of America.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- Andrew Getty, one of the heirs to billions of oil money, appears to have died of natural causes, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman said. The coroner's preliminary assessment is there was no foul play involved in the death of Getty, grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty, said Detective Meghan Aguilar. Andrew Getty, 47, had `` several health issues, '' Aguilar said, adding that an autopsy will be conducted. There is no criminal investigation underway, he said. Some medication had also been recovered from Getty's home, though investigators don't know whether Getty was taking it or what his medical history was, Ed Winter, assistant chief in the Los Angeles County coroner's office, told CNN affiliate KTLA Tuesday night. KTLA reported that Getty was found on his side near a bathroom in his home. Getty's parents, Ann and Gordon Getty, released a statement confirming their son's death and asking for privacy. Where the Getty family fortune came from. Gordon Getty is one of three living sons of J. Paul Getty, the oil baron who was thought to be the richest man in the world at the time of his death in 1976. Gordon Getty, 81, has a net worth of $1.5 billion, according to Forbes. He is survived by his wife and three children. He was born in New York City, where he was raised, and moved to Los Angeles in the early 1970s. He died of a heart attack at the age of 90 in a Los Alamos, New Mexico, home on Dec. 11, 1976. He had been living with his parents in New Mexico when he died. The family moved to New Mexico in the mid-1970s, where they lived with his mother and stepfather. He was a member of the New Mexico Republican Party and was a supporter of President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s and '90s. The Getty family has been active in the oil and gas industry for more than 40 years, and has been involved in many of the company's operations in the U.S. and abroad. The company has been a major player in the shale gas industry in the
-LRB- CNN -RRB- A year ago Bloomberg published a story with the following headline : Mike Pence, a Koch Favorite, Mulls 2016 Run for President. The story ticked off items on Pence's conservative things-to-do list while also noting his close ties to the deep-pocketed Koch brothers, as well as other right-wing lobbying groups. Last August the Indiana governor was in Dallas for an Americans for Prosperity event ; the group is backed by the conservative Koch brothers, and supported Gov. Pence's tax-slashing budget. Now, Pence is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians. Why would Pence ignore the pleas of Indiana's Chamber of Commerce as well as the Republican mayor of his state capital and sign such a bill? Because there's a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its 2016 candidate and this bill was Pence's way of shoring up his street cred. It is also the reason why Republican Jeb Bush, Pence's fellow White House hopeful, who is viewed as a little light in that category, was first to rush in to defend Pence and the law. One lesson here : Just because you're a conservative doesn't mean you have to be a conservative to run for president. It just means that you can't run for office if you're not a conservative. And that's exactly what Mike Pence is doing. He's running for president of the United States of America, and he's doing it in a way that's not just for the Kochs, but for all Americans.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Filipinos are being warned to be on guard for flash floods and landslides as tropical storm Maysak approached the Asian island nation Saturday. Just a few days ago, Maysak gained super typhoon status thanks to its sustained 150 mph winds. It has since lost a lot of steam as it has spun west in the Pacific Ocean. It's now classified as a tropical storm, according to the Philippine national weather service, which calls it a different name, Chedeng. It boasts steady winds of more than 70 mph -LRB- 115 kph -RRB- and gusts up to 90 mph as of 5 p.m. -LRB- 5 a.m. ET -RRB- Saturday. Still, that doesn't mean Maysak won't pack a wallop. Authorities took preemptive steps to keep people safe such as barring outdoor activities like swimming, surfing, diving and boating in some locales, as well as a number of precautionary evacuations. Gabriel Llave, a disaster official, told PNA that tourists who arrive Saturday in and around the coastal town of Aurora `` will not be accepted by the owners of hotels, resorts, inns and the like... they will be forced to leave the area.'' Posted by PNA at 12:00 PM I'm not sure what to make of this, but I'm sure it's a good sign that the Philippines is on track to become the world's most populous country by 2050. It's also a sign that we're on the cusp of a new era of prosperity and prosperity for all Filipinos.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>
Norfolk, Virginia -LRB- CNN -RRB- The second mate of the Houston Express probably couldn't believe what he was seeing. Hundreds of miles from land there was a small boat nearby. At first it looked abandoned. It was in bad shape, listing to one side. The crew of the 1,000-foot long container ship thought it was a yacht that had wrecked. Incredibly, as they got closer, they saw there was a man on it, signaling for help. `` He was moving, walking around, waving to us and in surprisingly good condition, '' Capt. Thomas Grenz told CNN by phone Friday. That man, Louis Jordan, 37, had an amazing story. He 'd been drifting on the 35-foot Pearson sailboat for more than two months since leaving Conway, South Carolina, to fish in the ocean. Just a few days into his trip, a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast. One of his shoulders was broken, too, so he couldn't fix the boat right away. Eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but he could make little headway against the currents. `` It took so long, '' Jordan said. `` It moved so slowly. '' The boat capsized in the middle of the night, and Jordan was taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. He was the only person on the ship who survived the accident. The ship's owner, the owner of the ship, said he had no idea what had happened to Jordan. He said he didn't know what to do with his life. `` I don't know how I got here, '' he said. '' I didn't even know what I was going to do. I just knew I had to get out of here. I had no choice but to do what I could to save my life. I couldn't do it alone. I knew it was my last chance to save myself. I thought I would die in the water. But I was not going to die alone. It wasn't going to happen to me. I was just going to go out there and do my part to save the lives of so many people. I
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Paul Walker is hardly the first actor to die during a production. But Walker's death in November 2013 at the age of 40 after a car crash was especially eerie given his rise to fame in the `` Fast and Furious '' film franchise. The release of `` Furious 7 '' on Friday offers the opportunity for fans to remember -- and possibly grieve again -- the man that so many have praised as one of the nicest guys in Hollywood. `` He was a person of humility, integrity, and compassion, '' military veteran Kyle Upham said in an email to CNN. Walker secretly paid for the engagement ring Upham shopped for with his bride. `` We didn't know him personally but this was apparent in the short time we spent with him. I know that we will never forget him and he will always be someone very special to us, '' said Upham. The actor was on break from filming `` Furious 7 '' at the time of the fiery accident, which also claimed the life of the car's driver, Roger Rodas. Producers said early on that they would not kill off Walker's character, Brian O'Connor, a former cop turned road racer. Instead, the script was rewritten to make him look like a man who had been killed in a car accident. The actor's family said they were devastated by his death, and that he would never be able to return to work again. Walker's family also said he was devastated by the death of his wife and children, who were also killed in the accident. The family said he had been in a relationship with a woman who had died in the car accident, but that he had not been able to find out who she was or where she had been living. Walker had been married to his wife's ex-boyfriend and had two children with them, according to his family. The couple had three children together, including a daughter, who was born with a congenital heart defect, and a son, who died of a heart attack at age 3. The death of the actor's wife and two of his children was also the subject of a lawsuit filed by his family, which
-LRB- CNN -RRB- The United States and its negotiating partners reached a very strong framework agreement with Iran in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Thursday that limits Iran's nuclear program in such a way as to effectively block it from building a nuclear weapon. Expect pushback anyway, if the recent past is any harbinger. Just last month, in an attempt to head off such an agreement, House Speaker John Boehner invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to preemptively blast it before Congress, and 47 senators sent a letter to the Iranian leadership warning them away from a deal. The debate that has already begun since the announcement of the new framework will likely result in more heat than light. It will not be helped by the gathering swirl of dubious assumptions and doubtful assertions. Let us address some of these :. The most misleading assertion, despite universal rejection by experts, is that the negotiations'objective at the outset was the total elimination of any nuclear program in Iran. That is the position of Netanyahu and his acolytes in the U.S. Congress. But that is not and never was the objective. If it had been, there would have been no Iranian team at the negotiating table. Rather, the objective has always been to structure an agreement or series of agreements that would allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapons capability. The goal was never to eliminate Iran's nuclear program, but rather to prevent it from developing a nuclear bomb. It was never intended to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, but to prevent them from developing such a weapon. In other words, the goal was not to eliminate the threat of a nuclear war with the United States, but instead to prevent the Iranian regime from developing an atomic bomb. That was the goal, not the goal of the negotiators, and it was never meant to be the goal. In fact, it was not even intended to be a goal at all. Rather, it was intended to ensure that Iran would be able to develop nuclear weapons in the event of a war, and that it would have the ability to do so in a way that would prevent the Iranians from developing any nuclear weapons. In short, that is the objective of the negotiations, and the goal is never to
-LRB- CNN -RRB- If you're famous and performing the American national anthem, be prepared to become a national hero or a national disgrace. Facts are facts. Just ask Vince, Whitney, Roseanne, Jimi and Michael. Mötley Crüe's Vince Neil reminded us again this week of the dangers of tackling `` The Star-Spangled Banner. '' Sure, he can shred it on `` Girls, Girls, Girls '' and `` Dr. Feelgood, '' but this is a different story -- a completely different story. To say Neil butchered the song before the Las Vegas Outlaws Arena Football League game would be unkind to those in the profession. There's less carnage when butchers are done with their work. The late Whitney Houston set the modern standard for the national anthem at Super Bowl XXV. In the early stages of the Gulf War in 1991, a patriotic America saluted her performance. Just six months earlier, comedian Roseanne Barr may have established the low-water mark. The crowd at the San Diego Padres game booed her rendition and President George H. W. Bush called it `` disgraceful. '' There's nothing quite like getting the presidential thumbs down. One of the most controversial moments in the history of the National Anthem came in the final minutes of the game against the New York Giants. It was the first time a national anthem had been played in the United States since World War II. The anthem was played at the end of the first half of the second quarter of that game and was played for the second time in the game's history. It was also the first national anthem played by a major-league baseball team since the Civil War. The National Anthem was played on the first day of the regular season of the World Series. The game was played to mark the beginning of World War I and was the only time the anthem played before the start of a game. The game ended in a tie for first place in the National Football League. The national anthem was also played at a time when the U.S. was in the throes of a civil war and the war was being fought in the South. The anthem played
London -LRB- CNN -RRB- A 19-year-old man was charged Wednesday with terror offenses after he was arrested as he returned to Britain from Turkey, London's Metropolitan Police said. Yahya Rashid, a UK national from northwest London, was detained at Luton airport on Tuesday after he arrived on a flight from Istanbul, police said.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- Sky watchers in western North America are in for a treat : a nearly five-minute total lunar eclipse this morning. Here's how it's unfolding :. It started at 3:16 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time, when the moon began moving into Earth's shadow. For the next hour and 45 minutes, that shadow will move across the moon and engulf it at 4:58 a.m. Pacific Time. The total eclipse will only last four minutes and 43 seconds, and NASA says that makes it the shortest one of the century. Watch it live on NASA TV. While people west of the Mississippi River will have the best view, at least a partial eclipse will be visible across the nation. But sunrise will interrupt the show on the East Coast. Parts of South America, India, China and Russia also will be able to see the eclipse, but it won't be visible in Greenland, Iceland, Europe, Africa or the Middle East. A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon form a straight line in space, with the Earth smack in the middle. The sun shines on the Earth and creates a shadow. As the moon moves deeper into that shadow, it appears to turn dark and bright. The shadow is then reflected back into space. The eclipse will last for a few minutes, and then it will be over. The moon will move back into Earth's shadow, and the eclipse will end. The eclipse lasts for about an hour and a half, and it will end with a total eclipse of the moon. It will be the longest lunar eclipse of all time.  The eclipse will take place in the northern hemisphere of the United States. It is the longest eclipse in the history of the Earth's orbit. It takes place at a distance of about 1,000 miles (2,000 kilometers) from the equator, and lasts about 1.5 hours. It ends at about 4:30 p.m., and lasts for a total of about 10 minutes. The totality of the solar eclipse will occur at about 6:30 a.d., and will be followed by a total solar eclipse of about 7:
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Standing up for what you believe. What does it cost you? What do you gain? Memories Pizza in the Indiana town of Walkerton is finding out. The family-run restaurant finds itself at the center of the debate over the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act after its owners said they 'd refuse to cater a same-sex couple's wedding. `` If a gay couple was to come and they wanted us to bring pizzas to their wedding, we 'd have to say no, '' Crystal O'Connor told CNN affiliate WBND-TV in South Bend. The statement struck at the heart of fears by critics, who said the new law would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians. They called for boycotts. But supporters also rallied. And by the end of the week, they had donated more than $ 842,000 for the business. Social media unloaded on the pizzeria in the community of 2,100 people that few folks outside northern Indiana knew existed before this week. RiskyLiberal tweeted : `` Dear #MemoriesPizza. No. My boycotting your business because I don't like your religious bigotry is not a violation of your freedom to practice your religion. '' `` Don't you know what it's like to live in a country where you can't discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity? It's not a place where you have the right to refuse service to a same sex couple. It's a place that you have no right to discriminate. You can't have your cake and eat it too. You have no rights to deny service to same sex couples. You don't have a right to deny services to people who don't identify as gay or lesbian. You're not allowed to discriminate on a basis of race, color, national origin, religion or sexual orientation. And you're not permitted to discriminate based on sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin. You've got to be careful what you wish for in this country. And if you don't want to be discriminated against, you're going to have to do something about it. And that's what we're here to do. We're here
-LRB- CNN -RRB- It's the kind of thing you see in movies, like Robert Redford's role in `` All Is Lost '' or Ang Lee's `` Life of Pi. '' But, in real life, it's hard to swallow the idea of a single person being stranded at sea for days, weeks, if not months and somehow living to talk about it. Miracles do happen, though, and not just in Hollywood. We're not talking about people who float aimlessly or run aground after running out of gas or being let down by faltering winds only to be picked up a few hours later by the U.S. Coast Guard. Much rarer are cases in which individuals become lost at sea long enough that they run out of whatever food and drinking water they 'd brought aboard, if any. In order to survive, they can't bank on technology or the proximity of a nearby city, town or boat -- but instead must rely on ingenuity, resourcefulness and luck. It's hard to say how many of these types of stories end sadly, with a sailor dying at sea, except that it is a much higher number than those that end in rescues. Such happy endings do occur -- but they are rarer than the ones that occur in the real world. In fact, there are only a handful of such stories in the history of the world, and most of them are stories that have been told by people who have been stranded for days or weeks or months or years or even decades or even millions of years. In many cases, the story ends with the person being rescued by the Coast Guard, but in other cases, it ends with them being rescued in the middle of the night. In some cases, a person is rescued by a Coast Guard vessel, but it is not always the case that they are rescued by an American Coast Guard ship, but rather by a group of people who are stranded on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. In such cases, there is no way to know whether or not the person was rescued or whether they were rescued by any other vessel or by any of the other people who were stranded. In
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Since Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979, women have been barred from attending most sports events involving men. But the situation appears set to improve in the coming months after a top Iranian sports official said that the ban will be lifted for some events. A plan to allow `` women and families '' to enter sports stadiums will come into effect in the next year, Deputy Sports Minister Abdolhamid Ahmadi said Saturday, according to state-run media. But it isn't clear exactly which games women will be able to attend. According to the state-run Press TV, Ahmadi said the restrictions would be lifted for indoor sports events. The rules won't change for all matches because some sports are mainly related to men and `` families are not interested in attending '' them, Press TV cited him as saying. Iranian authorities imposed the ban on women attending men's sports events after the revolution, deeming that mixed crowds watching games together was un-Islamic. During the ensuing decades, the crowds at soccer games, Iran's most popular sport, have been all male. Iranian women were briefly permitted to attend volleyball matches under the moderate President Mohammad Khatami, but the ban was reinstated in 2005 after the more hardline Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) banned women from participating in volleyball matches. The IRGC banned female athletes from competing in volleyball and volleyball-related events in 2006, but women were allowed to compete in volleyball-specific events in 2007 and 2008. In 2009, the IRGC imposed a similar ban on female volleyball players, but they were not allowed to participate in volleyball events. In 2010, IRGC President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced that women would not be allowed to play volleyball in the country's sports stadiums. The ban was lifted in 2012, but it remains in effect for volleyball and basketball. The Iranian government has been trying to reinstate the ban for some time, but officials say that it will not be lifted in the near future.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>
Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the deal six world powers struck to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions, saying he sees better options than `` this bad deal or war. '' `` I think there's a third alternative, and that is standing firm, ratcheting up the pressure until you get a better deal, '' Netanyahu told CNN's Jim Acosta Sunday on `` State of the Union. '' His comments come as Democrats and Republicans spar over the framework announced last week to lift Western sanctions on Iran in exchange for the country dropping from 19,000 to 5,060 active centrifuges, limiting its highly enriched uranium, and increasing inspections. President Barack Obama endorsed the deal, saying it was better than the alternatives. But GOP contenders for the party's 2016 presidential nomination lambasted it, saying it gave Iran too much flexibility. On Sunday, the sparring continued. One Senate Democrat said Netanyahu needs to `` contain himself. '' And a top Republican said almost any of Obama's successors as president `` could do better. '' Netanyahu's most recent argument against the Iran nuclear deal was similar to the one he 'd made in a March trip to Washington, when he addressed a joint session of Congress -- fueling a firestorm of criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike that the deal was a bad deal for Iran and a bad idea for the United States. Netanyahu's remarks come as the U.S. and its allies in the Middle East continue to grapple with the fallout from Iran's nuclear program, which they say is aimed at developing a nuclear weapon capable of producing a nuclear warhead that can be used to destroy Israel. The United States and other Western powers are also concerned about Iran's ability to develop a nuclear bomb capable of delivering a nuclear device to a target in the Persian Gulf, where it is believed to have stockpiled a stockpile of enriched uranium. Iran has said it has no intention of developing nuclear weapons, and the United Nations Security Council is considering a resolution that would require Tehran to halt its nuclear program. The U.N. Security Council on Sunday unanimously approved a resolution condemning the deal as a violation of international law and a threat to the security of the
-LRB- CNN -RRB- A trip to a former heavyweight champ's gaudy, abandoned mansion. The tallest and fastest `` giga-coaster '' in the world. A dramatic interview with a famed spiritual leader -- and the tearful reaction by one of his former students. These are some of the best videos of the week :. In the 1980s and '90s -- before he moved to Vegas and started keeping tigers as pets -- former heavyweight boxer Mike Tyson lived in a Southington, Ohio, mansion. The home featured an indoor swimming pool, a marble-and-gold Jacuzzi -LRB- with mirrored ceiling, naturally -RRB- and an entertainment room large enough for small concerts. Tyson sold the house in 1999 ; it's due to become, of all things, a church. The video can be seen at the top of this story. Not a fan of roller coasters? You may want to skip the next video -- but for the rest of us, the thrill of watching is the next best thing to being there. The Fury 325 can be found at Carowinds amusement part in Charlotte, North Carolina. Watch the video :. In a CNN exclusive, Alisyn Camerota looked into the history of the Fury 325 and found that it was built in the early 1900s and was built by a group of people who had been living in the area for a long time. They built the house on the site of one of the most famous roller coaster rides in North Carolina history. It was built on the same site as the original Fury 325, which was built at the same time as the first roller coaster in the state of North Carolina. The building was named after the first person to ride a roller coaster at the time, and the name of the building is a reference to the name given to the original roller coaster that was built there in the 1800s. The building's name was changed to the Fury 330 after it was purchased by the company that built it. The Fury 330 was the first of its kind in the United States, and it was the tallest roller coaster to ever be built. It was also the first to be built in
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Easter is a cornerstone event in the Christian faith, but it's surrounded by interesting quirks. It celebrates the completion of Christ's mission of salvation in the Crucifixion and Resurrection. By dying on Good Friday, Christ atoned for the sins of others ; by rising from the grave on Sunday, Christ conquered death. Simple enough and reason for Christians to celebrate. But, like Christmas with its tree, ornaments and Santa Claus, Easter has picked up its peripheral trappings -- the bunny and colorful eggs. Unlike Christmas, it doesn't fall on the same day every year but shifts around in spring depending upon cosmic events. And that blood moon we just had -- is it pure coincidence that it fell around Easter? -LRB- No. -RRB-. Here's a journey from the Vatican to the Holy Land, around the moon and the Earth's tilting axis, to Germany and the United States to try to explain the complex holiday called Easter. And you 'll learn to how to color Easter eggs with Kool-Aid. Let's start at the Vatican. At the Vatican, Holy Week began with Palm Sunday last week and culminated in Easter Sunday Mass with multiple celebrations in between. In the Vatican, Easter is celebrated on the first Sunday of each month, and on the third Sunday of the month, on the fourth Sunday of that month. In other words, it is a day of celebration and celebration of the Holy Spirit. It is also a day to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. In the Holy Roman Empire, Easter was celebrated on Easter Sunday, and on Easter Monday, on Easter Tuesday, and Easter Wednesday, on the fifth Sunday of every month. It was also celebrated on Christmas Eve, on Christmas Day, Christmas Day, and Christmas Day on the seventh day of every year. In fact, it was celebrated in the Roman Empire during the reign of Emperor Constantine, who was the first emperor to celebrate Easter on the eighth day of each year. The Roman Empire was also the first to celebrate Christmas on the eleventh day of the year, and it was the last to celebrate it on the twelfth
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Police in the Indian city of Malegaon, in the western state of Maharashtra, are requiring identity cards for an unusual group of residents : Cattle. Following a recent state-wide ban on the sale and consumption of beef, authorities in the city have asked residents to take a ` mugshot'of their cattle and submit it to the police. Along with the photograph, the residents have to give information about their animal's ` unique features,'such as the coloring and age of the cow, along with the length of its tail and other distinctive characteristics. Police officials believe this is the only way to solve cow slaughter cases and enforce the law. Cows are considered holy and revered by that state's majority Hindu population. `` We are creating a database. If we get an information of a cow slaughter, we can quickly go to the resident's place and check whether it is there or not '', Mahesh Sawai, Deputy Superintendent of Malegaon Police told CNN. `` I believe this will be very effective '' So far over 100 owners have complied with the police order and more are lining up outside police stations across the city to get their livestock photographed. The ruling came in the wake of a recent case in which a cow was killed by a man who was caught in the crossfire of a dispute over the sale of beef. The man was arrested and charged with slaughtering a cow, but was later acquitted of all charges. In the case, the man was found guilty of slaughtering the cow and was sentenced to death. The man's family has filed a petition with the Maharashtra High Court to have the case thrown out.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>
-LRB- CNN -RRB- The FBI charged a Philadelphia woman on Thursday with trying to travel overseas to fight for ISIS. She's one of three women arrested this week on terror charges. Two New York women were also taken into custody. An FBI complaint cites numerous social media messages dating back to August 2013 that were sent by Keonna Thomas, 30, also known as `` Young Lioness '' and `` Fatayat Al Khilafah. '' One Twitter message said, `` If we truly knew the realities... we all would be rushing to join our brothers in the front lines pray ALLAH accept us as shuhada -LSB- martyrs -RSB-. '' Another said, `` When you're a mujahid -LSB- violent jihadi fighter -RSB- your death becomes a wedding. '' The FBI said Thomas purchased an electronic visa to Turkey on March 23. Turkey is known as the easiest place from which to enter Syria and join ISIS. An ISIS manual advises recruits to buy round-trip tickets to vacation spots such as Spain and then purchase tickets for their real destination once they arrive overseas, the FBI said. On March 26, Thomas purchased a ticket to Barcelona, with a March 29 departure and an April 15 departure. She was charged with attempting to travel to Syria to fight with ISIS. The charges stem from an August 2013 social media message sent by Thomas to a friend. The message said, `` If you truly know the realities, you will be able to join your brothers in our front lines prayer allAH accept our martyrs as martyrs. We will be there for you. We are here for you.'' The FBI also said Thomas was arrested on March 26 on charges of attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border and attempting to enter the United States from Mexico. She is being held on $100,000 bail. She has not been charged with a crime.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Just as mimeograph machines and photocopiers were in their day, online activity -- blogs, YouTube channels, even social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter -- have fully emerged as the alternative to traditional mainstream media. It is not just the low cost of posting online that attracts dissidence, though that in itself is liberating. It is the lack of access to traditional print and broadcast media in authoritarian countries that is really the driving force leading disaffected voices to post online. It is not unique to Asia, but it might seem more pronounced if you live there. Going online has become the path of least resistance if you want to make yourself heard. But it still brings resistance, some of it legal, some of it deadly. Let's look at the legal angle first. Amos Yee, the teenage video blogger who was arrested and held pending bail Sunday in Singapore, drew international attention for his anti-Lee Kuan Yew harangue. But jailing critics is not usually the government's first choice in Singapore. It is part of Lee Kuan Yew's legacy that the government's use of the courts to bring libel and defamation cases, usually carrying heavy financial penalties, is the preferred method of silencing dissent. The government has also used the courts as a means to silence dissenters. In the case of Yee's case, the government has used the court to silence critics of the government. In this case, Yee was arrested after he posted a video on his Facebook page criticizing the government's handling of the death of Lee Hsien Loong, the former leader of the pro-democracy People's Democratic Party (PDP). Yee posted the video in response to Lee's death. The video was widely circulated on social media, and was widely criticized by the government for its lack of transparency and lack of accountability. In response to the video, the government issued a statement saying that Yee had been arrested for posting the video and that he had been released on bail pending further investigation. The government also said that the video had been posted on Facebook and that it had been viewed more than 1.5 million times on YouTube. Yee
Atlanta -LRB- CNN -RRB- Robert Lewis Burns Jr., the original drummer in Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, died Friday night in a car crash, a Georgia State Patrol spokesman said. Burns, 64, died after his car hit a mailbox and a tree in Cartersville, spokesman James Tallent said. No other cars were involved in the crash, which occurred shortly before midnight. `` He was not restrained at the time of the crash, '' Tallent told CNN. The musician lived in northern Georgia. Burns was part of the genre-defining band's original lineup, which formed in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1965. Lead singer Ronnie Van Zant started Noble Five with Burns, guitarists Gary Rossington and Allen Collins and bassist Larry Junstrom in their hometown. It then made a name change in a reference to a high school gym teacher. Lynyrd Skynyrd changed members over the years as it produced rock anthems including `` Sweet Home Alabama '' and `` Freebird. '' Burns left the band before its third studio album, `` Nuthin Fancy, '' in 1975, `` exhausted by touring, '' according to the band's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame biography. He was not a member of the band at that time, but he was a member in the early '70s and early '80s of the group. The band's first album, `` The Way We Were Born,'' was released in 1975. The album featured a cover of the Beatles' ''I Know You Rider'', which featured Burns as the lead singer. The album also featured the cover of a song by the Grateful Dead singer Jerry Garcia, which was featured on the album's cover. The band released its first studio album in 1975, ``The Way We Are Born,'' which featured the band as lead singer and guitarist. It was released on the same day as the band's second studio album, '' The Way I Was Born. '' The band also released their first album in 1977, `` We Are All One, '' featuring the band. The first album featured the Beatles as lead singers and guitarists. The second album included a cover by the
-LRB- CNN -RRB- When singer Avril Lavigne went missing from the music scene, there was tons of speculation. Was she pregnant? In rehab? Going through a split from her husband, Nickelback front man Chad Kroeger? Focus on the mystery intensified in December after a fan Twitter account posted a direct message from Lavigne when she solicited prayers, saying she was `` having some health issues. '' Now the Canadian singer has revealed to People magazine that she was bedridden for five months after contracting Lyme disease. `` I felt like I couldn't breathe, I couldn't talk, and I couldn't move, '' she told the magazine. `` I thought I was dying. '' Lyme disease : What you should know. Lavigne believes that she was bitten by a tick last spring. What followed was months of lightheadedness and lethargy that doctors were initially unable to diagnose. The 30-year-old performer said she recuperated in her Ontario home, where her husband would use tour breaks to care for her and her mother moved in to assist. `` There were definitely times I couldn't shower for a full week because I could barely stand, '' she told People. `` It felt like having all your life sucked out of you. I was so tired, I couldn't even walk. I had to go to the bathroom. It was like I was going to die. I didn't know what to do with myself. I just wanted to go home.

Atlanta -LRB- CNN -RRB- It was a scene worthy of any top cop show on TV -- bullets flying, banged-up cars and the FBI chasing an armed robbery suspect. In the end, two agents were injured in a crash and the suspect was shot before being captured. FBI agents and task force officers were following 36-year-old Kevone Charleston of Austell, Georgia, as he pulled into a CVS pharmacy in Forsyth County, Georgia, early Saturday. Charleston is suspected of involvement in 32 commercial robberies dating to November 2013, according to FBI officials. `` The incident all happened around 7 o'clock Saturday morning, '' said FBI Special Agent Stephen Emmett. `` There were multiple agents and officers that were following him based on his prior MO, and when they saw he was about to rob another CVS, they moved in. '' Authorities say Charleston parked his vehicle nearby and then popped the hood as if there were something wrong. Then he walked to the CVS, preparing to enter. When agents confronted him, Charleston ran, got in his car and traveled about 75 yards as agents opened fire. `` There were several FBI vehicles that were rammed or were hit by the suspect's vehicle when he was trying to flee. He was shot in the back of the head and was pronounced dead at the scene. The suspect was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- After years of making the case that the education of athletes is paramount, the NCAA now says it has no legal responsibility to make sure education is actually delivered. On its website, the NCAA prominently states, `` It's our commitment -- and our responsibility -- to give young people opportunities to learn, play and succeed. '' And later, it says that `` in the collegiate model of sports, the young men and women competing on the field or court are students first, athletes second. '' But the NCAA is taking a very different position in response to a lawsuit filed by former University of North Carolina athletes. The lawsuit claimed the students didn't get an education because they were caught up in the largest known academic fraud scandal in NCAA history. In its response, the NCAA says it has no legal responsibility `` to ensure the academic integrity of the courses offered to student-athletes at its member institutions. '' Even with pages of online information about academic standards, and even though the NCAA has established a system of academic eligibility and accountability that it boasts of regularly, NCAA attorneys wrote in this court filing that `` the NCAA did not assume a duty to ensure the quality of the education of student-athletes, '' and `` the NCAA does not have an obligation to ensure that students receive the appropriate level of education for which they are required to participate in the sport of football or basketball. '' The NCAA also says that the NCAA `` has no obligation to provide students with the same level of educational opportunities as other members of the NCAA. ''  The NCAA's response to the lawsuit comes as the NCAA continues to defend itself against a lawsuit brought by former athletes who say the NCAA failed to provide them with the education they needed to compete in the NCAA tournament. The NCAA says the lawsuit was filed in the wake of a lawsuit by former players who say they were told by the NCAA that they were not eligible to compete for the NCAA championship game because they did not have a college degree.  In a statement, the NCAA said, `` The NCAA is committed to providing the best possible education for its members, and we are committed to ensuring that all students have the opportunity to compete at the highest level of
-LRB- CNN -RRB- The world's biggest and most powerful physics experiment is taking place as you read this. The Large Hadron Collider -LRB- LHC -RRB-, a particle accelerator and the largest machine in the world, is ready for action following a two-year shutdown. After problems that delayed the restart in March, scientists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research -LRB- CERN -RRB- completed final tests, enabling the first beams to start circulating Sunday inside the LHC's 17 mile -LRB- 27 km -RRB- ring. `` Operating accelerators for the benefit of the physics community is what CERN's here for, '' CERN Director-General Rolf Heuer said on the organization's website. `` Today, CERN's heart beats once more to the rhythm of the LHC. '' The LHC generates up to 600 million particles per second, with a beam circulating for 10 hours, traveling more than 6 billion miles -LRB- more than 10 billion kilometers -RRB- -- the distance from Earth to Neptune and back again. At near light-speed, a proton in the LHC makes 11,245 circuits per second. It took thousands of hours of work to complete the first of these circuits, but it was completed in less than 24 hours. The LHS is the world's largest particle accelerator, with a capacity of 1.5 billion megawatts. It is the first particle accelerator to be built in the U.S. and the first to be used in a large-scale particle accelerator. The accelerator is expected to be operational by the end of the year, and it will be the largest in the history of particle accelerators. CERN has been working on the LHS for more than a decade, and it is the only particle accelerator on Earth that has been able to reach the speed of light. CERN is also working on a new particle accelerator that will be able to produce more particles than any other particle accelerator in the universe. The CERN particle accelerator will be operated by a team of scientists from CERN, the European Union and the United States of America.
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Residents of central Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, have learned the hard way that key strategic bombing targets are located in their neighborhoods : Detonating ordnance has been shattering their windows and doors. And fighting has killed hundreds of people in less than two weeks. The Saudi-led coalition smashed parts of Yemen's Defense Ministry Central Command in the capital over the weekend, senior Yemeni officials said. Under the rain of coalition bombs, the Houthis, who are Shiites in a majority Sunni country, still control Sanaa. But the airstrikes have hurt them and destroyed a lot of infrastructure. The electricity has gone out on 16 million Yemenis living in Houthi-held areas, the Yemeni officials said. Many fear they will lose access to clean water as well. Yemen's deposed President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi heaped scorn on top of the airstrikes. He fired his former Army chief of staff, Hussein Khairan, on Sunday. The firing had no practical effect, since Khairan had switched sides weeks ago and is the Houthi rebels'acting defense minister. Hadi is holed up in Saudi Arabia, which is working to defeat his enemies and reinstall him. Fighting has ended dozens of years of fighting between the two sides. The Houthis have been fighting each other for more than a decade, and are now fighting for control of Sanaa and the capital. The coalition has been bombing Houthi positions in the city for months, and has killed dozens of civilians. The United Nations has called for an end to the fighting, and the United States and its allies have called for a halt to the bombing. The U.N. Security Council has called on the United Nations Security Council to condemn the airstrikes, but has yet to do so. Yemen's government has said it will not allow the airstrikes to continue, and that it has no intention of giving up its fight against Houthi forces. The airstrikes have killed more than 2,000 people in the past two weeks, according to the U.S. State Department. The Yemeni government says it is fighting to restore order and stability in the country, but it has also said it is
-LRB- CNN -RRB- The United States has seemingly erupted this week about what it means to live your religion, especially in Indiana, where its new Religious Freedom Restoration Act faces a firestorm from critics who say it uses faith as a pretext to discriminate against gay people. Such state laws have been growing ever since the U.S. Religious Freedom Restoration Act became law in 1993, designed to prohibit the federal government from `` substantially burdening '' a person's exercise of religion. So far, 20 states have some version of the religious liberty law, and the legal controversies have grown, too. Nonetheless, claims under those state RFRAs are `` exceedingly rare, '' and victories involved mostly religious minorities, not Christian denominations, experts say. `` There is reason to doubt whether these state-level religious liberty provisions truly provide meaningful protections for religious believers, '' wrote Wayne State University law professor Christopher Lund in a 2010 analysis, when there were only 16 states with such laws. Here are some of the more interesting cases arising from the federal and state laws, touching upon an array of religious matters from a knife carried by an IRS accountant to a tea from the Amazon :. He was a Native American with eagle feathers at a religious gathering of tribes. But not in the eyes of the IRS, he said, because he was not a religious person. He was not allowed to wear a headscarf or a headband. He wasn't allowed to pray in public. He didn't have to pay a fine. And he wasn't required to attend a religious service. But he was allowed to attend religious services in public places. He couldn't wear a hat or a hat-trimmed hat. And so on. And so forth. And it's not just religious people who are being discriminated against. It's also people who don't believe in God or in the Bible or in Jesus Christ or in any of those things. It's people who aren't religious. And that's why it's so important for us to get to the bottom of what's really going on here. And I think it's important for the American people to know that this is not just a matter of religious liberty, it's a matter
-LRB- CNN -RRB- The terrorist group Al-Shabaab has claimed an attack on Garissa University College in eastern Kenya, in which many people have been killed and still more taken hostage. The attack is another step in the ongoing escalation of the terrorist group's activities, and a clear indicator that the security situation in East Africa is deteriorating fast. Somalia-based Al-Shabaab has been behind a string of recent attacks in Kenya, the most well-known of them being the massacre at the Westgate Shopping Centre in Nairobi in 2013. Cross-border raids into Kenya by the group, however, date back to 2011. Al-Shabaab incursions triggered a military response by the government in Nairobi, which sent troops to Somalia as part of an African Union mission in support of Somalia's internationally recognized government that had been under pressure from Al-Shabaab and other militants for several years. Al-Shabaab is predominantly driven by the same radical interpretation of the Koran as al-Qaeda and ISIS -LRB- also known as Islamic State -RRB-, but also employs more opportunistic approaches to shoring up local support. Its origins lie in Al-Ittihad al-Islami - The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which was founded in Syria in 2011 and has since spread across the Middle East and North Africa. The group has also claimed responsibility for attacks in the capital, Mogadishu, which killed more than 100 people and left more than 1,000 injured. The terror group has been blamed for the deaths of more than 2,000 people in the past two years, most of them civilians, and has also been blamed by the United States and the European Union for the attacks in Paris and Brussels, which left 130 people dead and more than 200 injured. In addition, the group has claimed to have carried out a series of suicide bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, including one in which a suicide bomber blew himself up in the Kenyan capital, KwaZulu-Natal, killing at least 20 people and wounding more than 50. The attacks have also been linked to the kidnapping and murder of a
-LRB- CNN -RRB- A Connecticut teen who has been forced to have chemotherapy to treat Hodgkin lymphoma will remain in temporary custody of the state for the time being, according to her attorney, Josh Michtom. A Connecticut juvenile court judge issued a written decision Wednesday denying a motion to let the teen, identified in court documents as `` Cassandra C., '' go home. The judge also denied a motion for visitation. The 17-year-old is in remission after nearly six months of forced chemo treatments. On March 16, Michtom tried to convince the court that she should be able to return to her mother's home because she was no longer at imminent risk of harm from her illness. Michtom and attorney Michael Taylor, who represents Cassandra's mother, Jackie Fortin, released a written statement after receiving the judge's decision Wednesday : `` We are disappointed in this ruling, not least of all because it draws a factual conclusion that is directly contradicted by the weight of the evidence. We're conferring with our clients now about next steps, including whether to take another appeal. '' Cassandra was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in September and medical experts gave her an 85 % chance of survival if treated with chemotherapy. Without it, doctors said, she would not have been able to live a normal life and would have to undergo chemotherapy for the rest of her life. The judge's decision to allow the teen to remain in custody is a victory for her mother and her family, who have been fighting for her release from the hospital. The teen's mother, who is also in remission from Hodgkin, said in a statement that she was "heartbroken" by the judge's ruling. She added that her daughter had been in the hospital for more than a month and that she had been told by doctors that she would be in a better condition than she was at the time of her diagnosis. She also said that she and her husband, who are both from Connecticut, have been in touch with her since the decision was issued. She said her daughter has been in constant contact with her mother since the ruling was issued, and that they have been trying to reach out to each other over the

The chilly continent recorded the temperature -LRB- 15.5 degrees Celsius -RRB- on March 24, possibly the highest ever recorded on Antarctica, according to the Weather Underground. The temperature was recorded at Argentina's Esperanza Base on the northern tip of the Antarctica Peninsula, according to CNN affiliate WTNH. -LRB- Note to map lovers : The Argentine base is not geographically part of the South American continent. -RRB-. The World Meteorological Organization, a specialized United Nations agency, is in the process of setting up an international ad-hoc committee of about 10 blue-ribbon climatologists and meteorologists to begin collecting relevant evidence, said Randy Cerveny, the agency's lead rapporteur of weather and climate extremes and Arizona State University professor of geographical sciences. The committee will examine the equipment used to measure the temperature, whether it was in good working order, whether the correct monitoring procedures were followed, whether the equipment was placed in the correct location and whether the measurement is matched by corresponding records from surrounding stations, Cerveny said. The committee will also look at the data collected by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA ) and the National Weather Service (NWS ), he said. The committee is expected to report its findings by the end of the year, he added. The U.N. agency is also working on a new climate model that will be used to forecast the future climate of the Antarctic Peninsula. The new model will be developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC ) and will be based on data collected during the last decade of the 20th century. The IPCC is the world's most influential climate scientist and is responsible for many of the most important scientific findings in the field of climate change. It is also responsible for the development of climate models that are used in many other areas of the world, such as climate models used in the United States and the United Kingdom.

Seoul, South Korea -LRB- CNN -RRB- The man accused of stabbing U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert in Seoul last month is now charged with attempted murder, a South Korean court official said Wednesday. Kim Ki-Jong has also been charged with assaulting a foreign envoy and business obstruction, the Seoul Central District Court official said. According to South Korean law, Kim's trial must begin within 14 days of receiving today's indictment. Lippert was stabbed March 5 during an event organized by the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation, which advocates peaceful reunification between North and South Korea. Shortly before Lippert was supposed to give a speech, the attacker slashed him in the face and jaw. The ambassador suffered a gash from his right cheekbone to his lower jaw that required 80 stitches. That wound measured 10 centimeters -LRB- 4 inches -RRB- long and 2.5 centimeters -LRB- 1 inch -RRB- deep, but there was no serious facial nerve damage, said Dr. Jung Nam-shik of the Yonsei Severance Hospital. Lippert also suffered five cuts in his left arm and hand, but was not expected to have permanent damage to his arm function. He was released from the hospital on Thursday. The attack was the latest in a series of attacks on U.N. peacekeepers in recent months that have left more than 1,000 dead and displaced more than 2 million people. The attacks have been blamed on North Korea and the United Nations Security Council, which has imposed sanctions on the North over its nuclear and missile programs. North Korea has denied any involvement in the attacks and has said the attack was an act of self-defense.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>
-LRB- CNN -RRB- President Barack Obama tied himself to the mast of a nuclear deal with Iran even before he became the Democratic candidate for president. Reaching a good, solid agreement with Iran is a worthy, desirable goal. But the process has unfolded under the destructive influence of political considerations, weakening America's hand and strengthening Iran. Obama's political standing and his historic legacy in foreign policy are so deeply intertwined with reaching an accord with Iran that if the deal ultimately collapses, he may fear that historians will conclude that his legacy in global affairs collapsed with it. There is a reason one gets the feeling that it is the United States and not Iran that is the more eager, even desperate, side in these talks, even though Iran is the country whose economy was sent into a deep chill by international sanctions ; the country whose only significant export, oil, lost more than half of its value in recent months. The reason is that Obama has a huge political stake in these negotiations. The President may insist that the United States will choose no deal over a bad deal, but few people truly believe he has a credible Plan B. Few believe it, particularly in the Middle East and notably among America's Arab friends, who hold the view that Iran is running circles around the U.S. and its allies in the region. In the end, it is a matter of whether the President is willing to accept a deal or not, and whether he will be willing to negotiate with Iran.  Obama's legacy in international affairs is so deeply embedded in his foreign policy that even if he were to be elected president, he would not be able to keep his promise to the American people that he would keep his promises to the people of Iran. He would be unable to keep the promise that he made to the Iranian people in the first place, and he would have to deal with the consequences of his failure to do so. In other words, if he is elected President, he will have to confront Iran's nuclear program with the same intensity and intensity that he has faced in the past.  In the end, it is up to the Iranians to decide whether or not they will accept the deal.

'' In response, the elder Sanders -- in front of his 912,000 followers -- reminded his son he has a trust fund, a condo and his own clothing line called `` Well Off. '' `` You're a Huxtable with a million $ trust fund. Stop the hood stuff! '' Sanders followed it up with another tweet that included the hashtags #versacesheets #Huxtable and #Trustfund. Junior is a wide receiver at Southern Methodist University, an aspiring entrepreneur and occasional rapper. His Twitter timeline is a mix of biblical verses, motivational quotes and references to sports, cars, school and Balenciaga shoes. He also has gone on record with his love for `` hood doughnuts, '' or confections from `` a place in the hood, '' saying `` if my doughnuts don't come in a plain white box, I don't want them! '' His father promptly put him in his place. Sanders Jr. seemed to take the public browbeating in stride, retweeting his father's comments. At least, that's what he told his son.  Sanders Jr.'s Twitter feed is filled with tweets from his father, including one that reads, `` I'm not going to lie to you, I'm a big fan of the hood doughnut. I love it. I'm going to go out and buy it. It's my favorite thing in the world. I don't know if I'll ever be able to buy it, but it's going to be a great thing for my family. I think it's gonna be great for my kids. I know they're going to love it, and I'm sure they'll be happy with it. But I'm just going to tell you, if you don't like it, don't buy it.''  He also retweeted a photo of his father with the caption, ``I'm not gonna lie to ya, I love the hood. I've been a fan of hood dough
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Blue Bell ice cream has temporarily shut down one of its manufacturing plants over the discovery of listeria contamination in a serving of ice cream originating from that plant. Public health officials warned consumers Friday not to eat any Blue Bell-branded products made at the company's Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, plant. That includes 3-ounce servings of Blue Bell ice cream from this plant that went to institutions in containers marked with the letters O, P, Q, R, S or T behind the coding date. The warning by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not affect other Blue Bell ice cream, including other 3-ounce servings, not made at the plant. But Blue Bell has recalled other products. The company is shutting down the Broken Arrow facility `` out of an abundance of caution '' to search for a possible cause of contamination. It is the third time Blue Bell has taken action in light of a listeria outbreak at a Kansas hospital that served the company's ice cream. Listeria monocytogenes was recently found in a cup of ice cream recovered from the hospital. The cup contaminated with the bacteria was produced at the Broken Arrow plant in April 2014, Blue Bell said. And, according to the CDC, it is the first time the company has recalled ice cream made at a facility in the U.S. that has been contaminated with listeriosis.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- When Hong Kong police answered a call in the early hours of a Saturday morning last November, they encountered a grisly scene and an alleged crime that shocked the city. One woman was lying on the floor with cuts to her neck and buttocks. Another was stuffed inside a suitcase on the balcony. A former banker, 29-year-old Briton Rurik Jutting, was charged with two counts of murder. On Thursday, a court hearing that was to determine whether there was enough evidence to proceed to trial was adjourned until May. Here's what we know so far about the victims and their alleged attacker. Jutting allegedly lived at the murder scene, an upmarket apartment in the middle of Wan Chai, an inner-city suburb that's home to an eclectic mix of late-night bars, residential tower blocks and local markets selling groceries and assorted cheap goods. In the early hours of Saturday morning, November 1, police say Jutting called them to the apartment. There they found a woman lying on the blood-splattered floor, later identified as 29-year-old Seneng Mujiasih. During a search of the apartment, officers uncovered another body hidden in a suitcase on top of the woman's body. The body was later found with a gunshot wound to the back of her head, police said. The woman was later pronounced dead at the scene. Police said the woman had been stabbed multiple times in the head and neck, and that she had been strangled to death with a kitchen knife. Police also said they found the body of a man who had been shot in the neck. The man was later identified by police as a man in his early 20s who had recently moved to Hong Kong and was living in the same apartment where the woman was found. The victim's family said they were shocked to learn of the alleged crime and were devastated by the loss of their loved one. The family said the victim's father, who lives in Hong Kong, told them he was shocked by the news of the murder and that his son had been a victim of the crime. The father said he had been living with his son
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Universal's `` Furious 7 '' continues to build momentum at the Friday box office for a weekend debut in the $ 135 million - $ 138 million range, the largest opening in North America since fall 2013. That includes a projected Friday take of $ 58 million - $ 60 million. The final film featuring the late Paul Walker, `` Furious 7 '' is opening around the globe this weekend and earned a record-breaking $ 60 million internationally on Wednesday and Thursday for a possible worldwide debut approaching or crossing $ 300 million by the end of Easter Sunday. `` Furious 7 '' is getting the widest release in Universal's history. Domestically, it will be playing in 4,003 theaters by Good Friday. Internationally, it has booked more than 10,500 screens in 63 territories, although it won't open in China, Japan and Russia until later. The current record-holder for top April opening domestically is `` Captain America : The Winter Soldier, '' which debuted to $ 95 million from 3,928 theaters last year. `` Furious 7 '' is likewise poised to nab the biggest opening of 2015 to date. And it will easily beat the $ 121.9 million launch of `` The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1 '' in its opening weekend for a second weekend in a row. The film is expected to open in the top 10 in the U.S. for the first time this year, and it is also expected to be the biggest domestic opening of the year for a sequel to the first film in the franchise. The film will be directed by David Ayer, who is also producing the film with his wife, Amy Pascal, who also wrote and directed the script. The script is based on the novel of the same name by Stephen King, which was published by HarperCollins in the United States in 2001. The story follows a group of young men who are sent on a mission to save the world from an evil that threatens to destroy it all. The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world where humans have been wiped out by a war that has been raging for more than a century. The world has been devastated by a series of disasters, including the
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Imprisoned soldier Chelsea Manning can now communicate with the world -- in 140 characters or less. Manning, who is serving a 35-year prison sentence for leaking thousands of classified documents, appears to have joined Twitter this week. In a series of tweets, the prisoner formerly known as Bradley Manning said she will be using a voice phone to dictate her tweets to communications firm Fitzgibbon Media, which will post them on her behalf. She is not allowed Internet access in prison, according to The Guardian. `` It will be hard, but I don't want this Twitter feed to be a one-way street/conversation, '' Manning posted to her nearly 26,000-plus followers. Manning was sentenced in 2013, and in August of that year, she said she wanted to transition to a female. The Fort Leavenworth Disciplinary Barracks in Kansas, where she is serving her sentence, has authorized hormone therapy for her treatment. Manning said she suffers from gender dysphoria. Her lawyers describe it as `` the medical diagnosis given to individuals whose gender identity -- their innate sense of being male or female -- differs from the sex they were assigned at birth, causing clinically significant distress. '' Last year, a Kansas judge sentenced Manning to life in prison without the possibility of parole. She was released on $10,000 bail in February. She has not been charged with a crime, but her lawyers say she may face up to 20 years in prison if convicted of a lesser charge.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>
-LRB- CNN -RRB- According to an outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors, '' -LRB- a -RRB- n institutional failure at Rolling Stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia. '' The Columbia team concluded that `` The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking. '' Hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication. The magazine's managing editor, Will Dana, wrote, `` We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout, including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students. '' Brian Stelter : Fraternity to ` pursue all available legal action'The next question is :. Can UVA, Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation? The Virginia Supreme Court said in Jordan v. Kollman that `` the elements of libel are -LRB- 1 -RRB- publication of -LRB- 2 -RRB- an actionable statement with -LRB- 3 -RRB- the requisite intent. '' `` Actionable '' means the statement must be both false and defamatory, and must be made in a manner that is not in violation of the First Amendment. '' In the case of the Rolling Stone article, the court found that the article had been published in a way that violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, veteran status, disability status, or national origin. The court also said that the publication of the article violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and that it violated Title VI of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which requires colleges and universities to provide sexual orientation and gender identity counseling to all students. In addition, the Court found that Rolling Stone's article violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibit the government from discriminating against a person based on his
-LRB- CNN -RRB- The classic video game `` Space Invaders '' was developed in Japan back in the late 1970's -- and now their real-life counterparts are the topic of an earnest political discussion in Japan's corridors of power. Luckily, Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government's top military official earnestly revealed that the country's Air Self Defense Force -LRB- ASDF -RRB- had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object. Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet, Japan's parliament, that his jets had, to date, never come across any UFOs from outer space. `` When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country's airspace, it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation, '' Nakatani said. He continued : `` They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I don't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth. '' Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as `` one of the best wrestlers in the world '' -- and has been featured in a number of TV shows and movies. He has also appeared in several movies and television commercials, including one in which he appears as a character in a movie. He is also a member of the wrestling team of the United States Olympic wrestling team, and has appeared as a wrestler in several wrestling movies and TV commercials. In addition to his wrestling career, he has also been involved in the development of a variety of video games and video games, such as the popular Super Mario Bros. series.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- The FBI has confirmed that one of its most wanted terrorists, the Malaysian bomb maker known as Marwan, was killed in an otherwise disastrous raid in the Philippines in January. Marwan, whose real name is Zulkifli bin Hir, was believed by the FBI to a member of southeast Asian terror group Jemaah Islamiyah's central command. The FBI said in February that a DNA sample -- understood to be from a severed finger -- taken from a man killed in a raid in the southern Philippines showed a link with a known relative of Marwan. But the FBI now says tests have confirmed that the dead man was the wanted Islamic extremist. `` After a thorough review of forensic data and information obtained from our Philippine law enforcement partners, the FBI has assessed that terrorism subject, Zulkifli Abdhir... is deceased and has been removed from the FBI's list of Most Wanted Terrorists, '' David Bowdich, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, told CNN in a statement. The FBI had been offering a $ 5 million reward for information leading to Marwan's capture in the wake of his 2007 indictment on terror charges in a California court. It accused him of being involved in a plot to blow up a U.S. military base in the Philippine capital, Manila, and of conspiring to carry out a terrorist attack on the United States. Marwan was arrested in March 2007 and charged with conspiring to commit a terrorist act. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. He has not been charged with any other crimes. The FBI says it has not yet determined whether Marwan's death was linked to his alleged involvement in the plot or whether he was involved in any other terrorist activity. He is being held at the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office in lieu of a $5 million bond.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- One of Tokyo's most prominent districts has taken a small, but potentially significant step to recognizing same-sex unions in Japan. The government of Shibuya ward, one of the capital's most famous shopping and trendy entertainment districts, passed ordinance on Wednesday paving the way for `` partnership certificates '' for same-sex couples, allowing them some of the rights of married heterosexual couples. Same-sex partners who are registered with the district's ward office will be able to hold visitation rights in hospitals and co-sign tenancy agreements. Other advantages that heterosexual married couples enjoy, such as joint filing of taxes, are controlled by the federal government and are outside the remit of individual municipalities. The measure was proposed in February by Shibuya's mayor, Toshitake Kuwahara. While the certificates will not be issued until later in the summer and are not legally binding, proponents of marriage equality in socially conservative Japan say that the ward's decision is a step in the right direction. `` It is not a marriage license and advantages will be limited but still better than nothing, '' Gon Matsunaka, a gay rights activist, told CNN. While Shibuya's decision does not yet equate to heterosexual marriage in Japan, it is an important step for gay rights in the country, he said. The ordinance is expected to go into effect in the first quarter of this year. The city of Tokyo has been a hotbed of gay and lesbian activity in recent years, with a large number of gay bars and nightclubs opening in the city in the past few years. In the past year, the city has seen a spike in the number of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) residents in the area, according to data compiled by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (JSPT). The JSPT is a non-profit organization that works to promote the rights and well-being of LGBT people in the Japanese society.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Film director David Lynch has confirmed he will no longer direct the revival of `` Twin Peaks '' -- a cult 1990s television show that was set to return in 2016. The offbeat TV series, created by Lynch and Mark Frost, featured a quirky FBI agent who went to the Pacific Northwest town of Twin Peaks to investigate the mysterious murder of a high school girl named Laura Palmer. The groundbreaking series is considered one of the most influential shows in television history. Lynch broke the news about his departure in a series of tweets, saying that the show's third season will continue without him. He said he felt the network was not offering enough money to produce the show `` the way it needed to be done. '' Lynch also wrote that he had personally called the actors over the weekend to let them know he would no longer be directing. Showtime Network, which will air the nine-episode comeback, released a statement saying they were `` saddened '' by Lynch's decision. `` We were saddened to read David Lynch's statement today since we believed we were working towards solutions with David and his reps on the few remaining deal points, '' read the statement. `` Showtime also loves the world of Twin Peaks and we continue to hold out hope that we will be able to bring the show back to life in the future. We look forward to working with David Lynch and his team to bring Twin Peaks back to the big screen in the near future.''  Lynch's departure comes just days after he announced that he would not be reprising his role as Bill Murray in the upcoming movie adaptation of the bestselling novel of the same name.  In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Lynch said that he has been working on the project for about a year and a half. He said that the project has been in the works for some time, but that it has not been finished yet. He added that he is not sure if he will be returning to the role of Bill Murray, but said he is happy to be back in the role.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- Six people were hurt after an explosion at a controversial chemical plant in China's southeastern Fujian province sparked a huge fire, provincial authorities told state media. The plant, located in Zhangzhou city, produces paraxylene -LRB- PX -RRB-, a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics. The blast occurred at an oil storage facility Monday night after an oil leak, though local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill. Five out of six people were injured by broken glass and have been sent to the hospital for treatment, Xinhua news agency reported. More than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and the fire is now under control, the Zhangzhou fire department wrote on their official microblogging account Tuesday morning. Residents living close to the plant had heard the explosion and took to Weibo to post photos of the fire. One user wrote that he heard a loud blast and felt slight tremors. The plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, although there were no reports of casualties or toxic leaks at the time. Though demonstrations are illegal in China, the construction of PX plants has sparked protests, which have occasionally turned violent, in several cities and towns in the country.  China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported that the explosion was caused by a "large-scale explosion" at a chemical plant that produces polyester film and fabric. The explosion occurred in a warehouse in the city of Zhangzhou, where the plant is located, the news agency said.  The explosion was reported at about 10:30 p.m. local time (11:30 a.m., local time), Xinhua said, adding that the cause of the blast was not yet known. . The plant is situated in a densely populated area of Fujian Province, which has a population of about 1.5 million people. It produces a variety of materials such as polyester, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene, polyester-based polymers, and polyurethane. The chemical plant produces a wide range of materials including polyester,
-LRB- CNN -RRB- The presence of a harmful pesticide at a luxury villa in the U.S. Virgin Islands may have resulted in the illness of a Delaware family, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday. Paramedics were called last week to a rented villa at the Sirenusa resort in St. John after the family of four fell ill. They had rented the villa from March 14 to March 22, and were later hospitalized. The illness was reported to the EPA on March 20. `` Our preliminary results do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying, '' said Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman. Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. `` It's an ongoing investigation ; we're still on the island doing our assessment, '' Rodriguez said. `` We have been doing different types of air sampling and wipe sampling. '' Final test results were expected next week. The EPA has not released any further information about the cause of the illness, but it is possible that the family may have been exposed to the pesticide in the past, Rodriguez said.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- When I was elected to the Kentucky State Senate in 1967, I became the first woman and the first person of color to serve in the body. Five decades later, I find it almost unfathomable that a politician from my own state is attempting to launch his presidential campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting rights and civil rights legislation. But that is what Rand Paul, who today declared he's running for president of the United States, is doing. His campaign team told reporters last week that his campaign announcement message would be about `` expanding the Republican Party '' -- a message of inclusion. But those of us listening today who he is hoping to include, heard nothing more than hype. I'm not buying it. Since coming to the U.S. Senate, Paul has tried to sell himself as a different type of Republican. He's tried to brand himself as the GOP's minority outreach candidate. The problem for Paul, and the GOP at large, is that they don't back up their words with their policies. Yes, it's about time that Republicans started seriously considering the fact that black voters are an important piece of the electoral puzzle. But they can't actually appeal to the community unless they are talking about the issues that matter most to them. It's time for the GOP to stop trying to sell itself as the party of the people. It's time for them to start talking about what they really mean when they say they want to expand the party to include black voters. It is time for Republicans to stop pretending that they are the only party that cares about black people. And it is time to start listening to the voices of black Americans who are struggling to make ends meet.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>
-LRB- CNN -RRB- The United States Department of Justice has named a new defendant in the war on drugs, and the charges are serious indeed. A 15-count indictment filed in federal court in California bristles with accusations of conspiracies, transporting prescription pharmaceuticals dispensed with illegal prescriptions, violations of the Controlled Substances Act, misbranding charges, and money laundering charges. Who is this menace to society? FedEx. Yes, the courier delivery service. Wait, can companies even be charged with crimes? Where would a FedEx be incarcerated? Is there a corporate Shawshank Prison? How does one fit a company for a prison jumpsuit? It turns out a corporation can indeed be prosecuted like a person. It's a practice the Supreme Court has approved of for over a century. In fact, in many ways they are easier to prosecute than people. Corporations don't have all the same inconvenient constitutional rights as citizens accused of crimes. Imprisoning convicted citizens is expensive, but corporate convictions, on the other hand, turn tidy profits for the U.S. government, with zero prison overhead. Even if corporations can be held criminally liable, should a courier service like FedEx be held liable for `` possessing '' what bad guys may send through the mail? If the government can't prove that the courier service is a criminal enterprise, then it can't be held accountable for its actions. In other words, the government has no right to charge a company like FedEx with a crime, even if the company is guilty of a crime. The government has the right to prosecute companies like FedEx, but it has to prove that they are guilty of crimes, and that the company has committed a crime in the first place. If a company is convicted of a criminal offense, then the government must prove that it has committed the crime in order for it to be held responsible for the company's actions. And if the government cannot prove that a company was guilty of the crime, then they can't charge the company with any crime at all. In short, if a company can be charged criminally with a criminal act, then that company has no legal standing to sue the government for damages, and it has no
-LRB- CNN -RRB- This is the end. Beautiful friend, the end. For the 1960s, the end arrived with -- depending on your ideals and your tribe -- either the Rolling Stones'Altamont fiasco in December 1969, the Kent State shootings in May 1970 or Richard Nixon's 1972 re-election. For `` Mad Men, '' the `` end of an era, '' as its slogan has it, begins Sunday. Over the past eight years, the show about a 1960s advertising agency and its collision with changing times has become part of the national fabric, if never a huge ratings hit. Stores have created fashion lines inspired by the show ; there have been `` Mad Men '' cocktails and `` Mad Men '' museum exhibits and even `` Mad Men '' presidential references. Don Draper, the creative director played by Jon Hamm, has become a symbol of the times -- his and, sometimes, ours. Its subjects have taken the show to heart. In March, a `` Mad Men '' bench was unveiled in front of New York's Time & Life Building, where the fictional firm of Sterling Cooper & Partners has its headquarters. The end of a TV series brings with it some risk. `` The Sopranos, '' `` Mad Men '' creator Matthew Weiner, '' and '' Mad Men'' co-creator Robert Kirkman, '' have all come to the end of their respective careers. The show has become an important part of American culture, and it has been a major part of our culture for decades. It has been an essential part of America's history and culture for generations. It is a show that has been around for a long time, and it will continue to be so for many years to come. It will be an important show for many generations to come, but it will also be a great show for a lot of people to watch. And it will be a good show for the rest of us to watch, too. It's a show for everybody. And I think it's going to be a wonderful show for all of us. And we're going to have a great time watching it. And that's what I'm going to do. I'm not going to tell you what
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Comedian Chris Rock made light of racial disparities in police treatment of whites and blacks with a tongue-in-cheek guide to not being beaten by the police. He encapsulated the frustration and grief caused by a New York grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer in the death of a black man with a simple tweet : `` This one was on film. '' Now, he's stirring things up again with a series of tweets documenting three traffic stops in seven weeks. `` Stopped by the cops again wish me luck, '' he posted early Tuesday, along with a photo showing him behind the wheel of a car with what looks like blue police lights in the background. He posted similar photos in February. Many African-Americans have long bemoaned the phenomenon of being pulled over for no apparent reason, calling it `` driving while black. '' Blacks are about 30 % more likely to be pulled over by police than whites, according to figures reported by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2013. And in amid increased conversation over race and policing after the high-profile deaths last year of Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the issue is even more sensitive. Rock hasn't commented on the matter since the grand jury's decision to indict Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, who was shot by a white officer while he was on the ground in the middle of a traffic stop. He has also not responded to questions about whether he has ever been charged with a crime, or if he has been convicted of a crime. In an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday, Rock said he has not been charged in any of the three fatal police shootings of black men in the U.S. over the past five years. He said he was not aware of any charges being filed against him in those cases, and that he had no plans to do so. He also said he did not know if he would be charged with any crime in the case, and said he would not comment on whether he had ever been arrested for a crime or whether he would have been charged if he had been charged.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- One hundred and forty-seven victims. Many more families affected. Even more broken hopes and dreams. As Kenyans mourned those killed last week in one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in the nation, citizens used social media to share the victims'stories, hopes and dreams. Using the hashtag # 147notjustanumber -- a reference to the number of people, mostly students, killed at Garissa University College on Thursday -- Kenyans tweeted pictures of the victims in happier times. Kenyan authorities have not released a list of the victims. The posts provided heart-wrenching details on the victims, including one about an elderly man whose dreams died with his son. He had reportedly taken a loan to educate him at the university, where he was killed by Al-Shabaab terrorists. The attack in Kenya killed 142 students, three security officers and two university security personnel, and was the nation's deadliest since the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 1998. Kenyan churches mourned the dead during Easter services Sunday as armed guards protected the congregations. In emotional services nationwide, churchgoers wept as they paid tribute to the victims of the massacre. The gunmen who attacked the university in the predawn hours separated them from the rest of the congregation, leaving them to fend for themselves in the streets of the capital, KwaZulu-Natal, where they were gunned down by security forces. In a statement, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta called the attack a "horrific act of terror" and said he was "deeply saddened" by the deaths of the students and staff of the University of Kenya. "I am deeply saddened by the loss of the lives of our students, faculty and staff," he said in a statement. "We are deeply saddened to learn of the tragic loss of our beloved students and faculty. We will continue to work with the authorities to bring justice to the families of those who lost their lives in this senseless act of senseless violence."

Marseille, France -LRB- CNN -RRB- Investigators have collected all the main evidence from the site where Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed, a French national police official told CNN on Saturday. Investigators are not expected to return to the crash site, said Capt. Yves Naffrechoux of the High Mountain Gendarmerie. The plane crashed March 24 in rugged terrain of the Alps about 6 miles -LRB- 10 kilometers -RRB- from the town of Seyne-les-Alpes. `` All the police investigators have left the -LRB- Germanwings -RRB- crash site, '' he said. `` There is only a private security company ensuring security around the crash site so that no one can go there. '' The security firm will guard the site until the remaining debris is collected and taken to secure locations for further analysis, if necessary, he said. The flight data recorder, or `` black box, '' was found Thursday by a member of the recovery team. The cockpit voice recorder was found days after the crash. In addition, out of more than 2,000 DNA samples collected from the crash site, lab workers have isolated 150 DNA profiles, said Brice Robin, Marseilles prosecutor. The crash killed all 298 people on board the plane, including the pilot and two crew members, and injured more than 1,000 others, he added. The investigators are still trying to determine the cause of the crash and whether the plane was hijacked or crashed by a terrorist group, Robin said.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Authorities identified and charged a man Monday in connection with the discovery of human remains in a duffel bag in Cambridge, Massachusetts, over the weekend. Carlos Colina, 32, was arraigned on charges of assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and improper disposal of a body, the Middlesex District Attorney's Office said in a statement. `` This was a gruesome discovery, '' said District Attorney Marian Ryan. `` Detectives are continuing to analyze evidence and awaiting information from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner so that we may determine if additional charges are warranted. '' Police were notified Saturday morning about a suspicious item along a walkway in Cambridge. Officers arrived at the scene, opened a duffel bag and found human remains. After that discovery, police say, a surveillance video led them to an apartment building, where more body parts were discovered in a common area. That location is near the Cambridge Police Department headquarters. The remains at both locations belonged to the same victim, identified Monday as Jonathan Camilien, 26. Camilien and Colina knew each other, according to authorities. The next scheduled hearing in the case is set for April 14.

Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates -LRB- CNN -RRB- Lost luggage after a long flight is a common, frustrating occurrence of modern air travel. And sometimes, airlines lose things that are irreplaceable. American Jennifer Stewart says she was devastated to learn that Etihad Airways lost her most important baggage following a recent trip from Abu Dhabi to New York City : her 2-year-old pet cat, Felix. Stewart said that she and her husband, Joseph Naaman, booked Felix on their Etihad Airways flight from the United Arab Emirates to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on April 1. Shortly after the plane arrived in New York that evening, Felix went missing somewhere on the grounds of Kennedy Airport, according to Etihad Airways. Felix was able to get loose, Stewart said she believes, because the cat's plastic carrier was badly damaged at some point either during the flight or the transfer from the airplane to the pickup area. Stewart said a cargo manager called the couple to an office after they landed at Kennedy last week and notified them that their cat's carrier had been crushed. Photographs taken by Stewart showed a large hole in the top of the cat's carrier. At least one of the corners of the case appeared partially collapsed, Stewart told CNN. The cat's carrier was also badly damaged, she said, and the cat had to be taken to a veterinary clinic to be euthanized. Stewart said her husband and Felix were able to return to the United States after the flight was over, but they were unable to get back to the airport because of the damage to the carrier. The airline said it is working with the U.S. Department of Transportation to determine the cause of the loss of Felix's cat, but it is unclear if the airline will be able to recover the lost luggage. Stewart added that the airline is working to find out what happened to the cat, and if it is still alive, she hopes that it will be reunited with its owner.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- For those wondering if we would ever hear from the Bluth family again, the answer would appear to be yes. `` Arrested Development '' executive producer Brian Grazer said the show will return for a fifth season of 17 episodes. The Hollywood mogul was interviewed on Bill Simmons'podcast recently, and let it drop that fans can expect more of the quirky comedy. Netflix had no comment for CNN when asked to verify his statements. The fourth season was streamed exclusively on Netflix in 2013, after Fox canceled the show several years before. Despite critical acclaim, the series never had big ratings, but has a devoted fan base, who often quote from the show. It was not yet known if the full cast, including Jason Bateman, Michael Cera and Will Arnett, will return for the season. <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>This is the first of a two-part series on the history of the U.S. military.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- Easter is unique on the Christian calendar, a major point in the cycle of the religious year, and one that has always been able to resist the commercialization and culture warring that surrounds Christmas. That's in part because Easter is genuinely about how religious impulses, and patterns, can operate in ways that affect our lives. Nevertheless, I'm often surprised by how little people, even those supposedly within the Christian tradition, actually know about what is called Holy Week and its culmination on Easter Sunday. At a time when our culture is roiled by questions of identity and ethics -LRB- and tolerance -RRB- that have profound religious implications, it's worth pausing to explore this crucial holiday -- and the awareness of the human condition, in all its sadness and glory, that it engenders. After all, Holy Week calls mostly to those who incline their minds and hearts in its direction with seriousness of intent. Still, the fuss must puzzle those looking on, wondering what it all means. Why do Christians make so much of this springtime week, and make so much of Easter weekend? There is a phrase that many never come across, even among Christians : Easter Triduum. This refers to the three days of the month of Easter, which are celebrated on the first Sunday of each month. The first of these three days is the day of the Lord's Supper, and the second of these two days is Easter Sunday, which is celebrated on Easter Monday. In other words, the first of the three day of Easter is the time when the Holy Spirit is at work in the hearts of the people of God. The second of the two days, the third of the third day, and the fourth of the fourth day are the days when the Spirit of God is working in the minds of the Christian people. The fourth of these four days is also the day when Jesus Christ is to be crucified on the cross. The fifth of the fifth day, the sixth of the sixth day, is also a day when the Lord will be glorified in the resurrection of the dead. The seventh of the seventh day is also an Easter day, and is
-LRB- CNN -RRB- `` Sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven ; then come, follow me, '' Jesus tells the rich man in one of his best-known parables. It was a mantra he invoked repeatedly : the poor were blessed, and it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it was for the well-to-do to enter paradise. Meanwhile, Jesus told his Twelve Apostles to leave their day jobs and follow him on an itinerant mission with few prospects of success and no visible means of support. So how did this wandering band of first-century evangelists support themselves? Clearly, money was a concern, and not just as an impediment to salvation. In the New Testament, money gets 37 mentions, while `` gold '' gets 38 citations, `` silver '' merits 20, and `` copper '' four. `` Coin '' comes up eight times, and `` purse '' and `` denarii '' -- the Roman currency -- get half a dozen mentions each for a total of 119 currency referrals. Perhaps the most relevant reference is also one of the most charged passages in the New Testament :. As the Gospel of John tells it, six days before Christ's crucifixion, the Twelve Apostles went to Jerusalem to pray for the poor. They were told that if they did not follow Jesus, they would die in hell. They were also told that they would have to give up their lives for the sake of Jesus Christ, and that they were to die in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. In other words, they would not be able to live in heaven, and they would be unable to receive the Holy Spirit. Jesus told them that they had to go to hell, and he told them to go back to the land of Egypt, where they would receive the Spirit of God. The Twelve Apostles then went back to Jerusalem and prayed to God for help. The Lord said to them, " Go back to Egypt, and I will give you the Holy Ghost." They went back, and the Lord said, " I will send you back to your land, where you will be saved." The Twelve
-LRB- CNN -RRB- The nation's top stories will be unfolding Tuesday in courthouses and political arenas across the country. Massachusetts is hosting two of the highest-profile court trials in recent memory -- those of former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez and Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Both lengthy trials are coming to a close. In Louisville, Kentucky, Sen. Rand Paul made the not-so-surprising announcement that he will run for president, while in Chicago, voters will head to the polls in a very surprising runoff between Mayor Rahm Emanuel and challenger Jesus `` Chuy '' Garcia. And in Ferguson, Missouri, the shadow of Michael Brown and the protests over his shooting by Officer Darren Wilson will loom large over the city's elections. Here's a breakdown of what to expect today and how we got here :. Tsarnaev, who's accused of detonating a bomb at the 2013 Boston Marathon along with his now-deceased brother, faces the stiffest of penalties -- life in prison or the death penalty -- if he's found guilty on any of 17 capital counts against him, including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. The 13th juror : What defense attorneys say is that Tsarnaev is not a threat to the United States, and that he is not likely to be convicted of any of the charges against him. He is also not a danger to the public because he has not been charged with a crime, and he has no criminal record. He has no history of mental illness or substance abuse problems, and has no prior criminal history. He was born and raised in Boston, where he was raised. He was raised by his father, who was a police officer, and his mother, who is a nurse. His father was an Army veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. His mother was a nurse, and her husband was a military veteran. He is a naturalized U.S. citizen and has lived in the country for more than a decade. He has not had a criminal record in the past, and has never been convicted of a crime. He also has no previous criminal record, and is
Cedar Falls, Iowa -LRB- CNN -RRB- As aides politely tried to rush Ted Cruz from an event in Cedar Falls to one in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Thursday, the presidential candidate continued shaking hands with anyone who wanted to meet him. Finally, after the selfies and conversations started to die down, his aides managed to move him closer to the door when a tall, burly man stopped him. `` Senator, '' he said, `` can I pray with you real quick? '' `` Yeah, '' Cruz said, as he clasped the man's upper arm and the two bowed their heads. It was one of the many moments when Cruz connected with voters on a religious level last week, as the senator from Texas hit the trail in Iowa for the first time as a presidential candidate. Being the only official contender in the race, Cruz drew large crowds during his two-day swing across the state. He's counting on Iowa, known for its vocal and active evangelical base, to propel him forward in what's expected to be a tough competition among a crowded field of GOP candidates. Cruz, himself, displays a pastoral swagger when he is speaking on stage and working a room. The senator regularly avoids using a podium, instead favoring pacing the stage with his hands in front of him. He is also known for his ability to get people to listen to him, as well as his willingness to speak his mind. Cruz has been a vocal critic of President Barack Obama's handling of the Iran nuclear deal. He has also been critical of President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. Cruz is also a vocal opponent of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry tar sands oil from Alberta to refineries in the U.S., and has called for a ban on hydraulic fracturing in the United States. Cruz also has been vocal about his opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP ) trade deal, a trade deal that would allow American companies to export their products to other countries in the Pacific Ocean. He also opposes the Keystone Pipeline, a controversial oil pipeline that would carry crude oil from Canada to the Gulf Coast of Mexico. In addition, he has been critical
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Just kill it already. That was the sentiment of many `` Vampire Diaries '' fans on Tuesday after star Nina Dobrev announced she will be leaving the CW show at the end of this season. `` I always knew I wanted Elena's story to be a six season adventure, and within those six years I got the journey of a lifetime, '' she posted on her social media accounts after a `` goodbye party '' at Lake Lanier outside Atlanta, where the show is filmed. `` I was a human, a vampire, a doppelganger, a crazy immortal, a doppelganger pretending to be human, a human pretending to be a doppelganger. I got kidnapped, killed, resurrected, tortured, cursed, body-snatched, was dead and undead, and there's still so much more to come before the season finale in May. '' And while that may be true, fans were feeling a little jilted. Many chastised the show's producers, some even Dobrev herself, for allowing the show to go on to a seventh season this fall after she departs. Many were upset that Dobrev's departure could sink hopes of seeing a satisfying denouement to the relationship between Elena and Elena's father, who died in a car accident last year. Some even questioned whether the show would be able to keep up with the pace of the show's second season if it were to continue on its current trajectory. Others questioned whether it would be possible for the series to continue without Dobrev as the main character. Others wondered if the show was going to end up as a series about Elena and her relationship with her father, who died of a heart attack last year, or if it would end up being about Elena's relationship with Elena's mother, who was killed by her own father in a tragic car accident. And some wondered whether the series would continue to be about Elena, who is a vampire and has been living with her mother for the past seven years, or about Elena, who has been a vampire for the last seven years. Some wondered whether it was possible for Dobrev to stay on the show after she left the
Beijing -LRB- CNN -RRB- China's state prosecutors on Friday formally charged the country's former security czar with accepting bribes, making him the highest-ranking Chinese Communist Party official ever to face corruption charges. Zhou Yongkang, 72, was also charged with abuse of power and leaking state secrets, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the highest prosecution authority in China, said. As a member of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee -- China's top decision-making body -- Zhou was one of nine men who effectively ruled the country of more than 1.3 billion people. He retired in 2012. At the height of his power, Zhou controlled police forces, spy agencies, court systems as well as prosecution offices across China -- and wasn't shy in deploying his vast assets to crush dissent and unrest in the name of `` preserving social stability. '' Now, prosecutors have accused Zhou of `` taking advantage of his posts to seek benefits for others and illegally accepting huge amounts of money '' during his long political career. His alleged actions have caused heavy losses to public assets and greatly harmed national interests, they added. Zhou was notified of his legal rights during the investigation and his lawyer's views were heard, the prosecutors said. The charges are the latest in a string of high-profile corruption charges against Zhou, who has been under house arrest in China for more than a year. He has been charged with bribery and embezzlement of state funds, corruption of state officials and emblazoned with a red cross on his head. He faces up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. Zhou is also accused of accepting bribes of up to $100,000 in exchange for his services as a top official in the People's Liberation Army, the Communist Party of China, or the Communist People's Republic of China. He is accused of receiving bribes totaling more than $100 million in bribes from a number of government officials and businessmen, including the head of China's largest state-owned oil company, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported on Friday. Zhou has also been accused of using his position as head of the Communist Central Committee of the
New Delhi, India -LRB- CNN -RRB- Police have arrested four employees of a popular Indian ethnic-wear chain after a minister spotted a security camera overlooking the changing room of one of its stores. Federal education minister Smriti Irani was visiting a FabIndia outlet in the tourist resort state of Goa on Friday when she discovered a surveillance camera pointed at the changing room, police said. Four employees of the store have been arrested, but its manager -- herself a woman -- was still at large Saturday, said Goa police superintendent Kartik Kashyap. State authorities launched their investigation right after Irani levied her accusation. They found an overhead camera that the minister had spotted and determined that it was indeed able to take photos of customers using the store's changing room, according to Kashyap. After the incident, authorities sealed off the store and summoned six top officials from FabIndia, he said. The arrested staff have been charged with voyeurism and breach of privacy, according to the police. If convicted, they could spend up to three years in jail, Kashyap said. Officials from FabIndia -- which sells ethnic garments, fabrics and other products -- are heading to Goa to work with investigators, according to the company. `` FabIndia is committed to providing a safe and secure environment for its employees and customers,'' the company said in a statement on Saturday. The company said it was cooperating fully with the police investigation. The company also said it would cooperate with the Indian government in its investigation.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Nine British citizens were arrested in Turkey on Wednesday, suspected of trying to cross illegally into Syria, the Turkish military said on its website. The group included four children -- the oldest being 10 or 11, with the youngest born in 2013, a Turkish official told CNN on condition of anonymity. The nine were arrested at the Turkey-Syria border, the Turkish military said. It didn't say why the group allegedly was trying to get into Syria, which has been torn by a roughly four-year war between Syrian government forces and Islamist extremist groups and other rebels. Among the war's combatants is ISIS, which has taken over parts of Syria and Iraq for what it claims is its Islamic caliphate, and which is known to have been recruiting Westerners. Accompanying the children were three men and two women ; all nine had British passports, the Turkish official said. UK police charge man with terror offenses after Turkey trip. The British Foreign Office said Wednesday that it is aware of reports of the arrests and that it is seeking information about the incident from Turkish authorities.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- A nuclear submarine being repaired at a Russian shipyard has caught on fire, according to a law enforcement source speaking to Russia's state-run news agency ITAR-Tass. `` The submarine is in a dry dock, '' Tass reports, citing the source, and there is no ammunition on board. `` The rubber insulation between the submarine's light and pressure hull is on fire, '' Tass reported. Russia's RIA Novosti news agency says insulation caught on fire as welding work was being done on the submarine. Tass reported that the fire began on a sub in the Zvyozdochka shipyard in northwestern Russia. Zvyozdochka spokesman Yevgeny Gladyshev told the news agency that the sub had been undergoing repairs since November 2013. `` Nuclear fuel from the sub's reactor has been unloaded, '' he reportedly said. `` There are no armaments or chemically active, dangerous substances, fissionable materials on it, '' Gladyshev said to Tass. `` The enterprise's personnel left the premises when the submarine caught fire, no one has been injured. The fire presents no threat to people and the shipyard. ''  Russia's news agency reports that the submarine has been undergoing repair since October 2013.  The Russian news agency also reports that a Russian submarine has caught fire on a ship in the Baltic Sea. The shipyard is located in the Black Sea region of Lithuania. The incident occurred in the early hours of November 3, when the vessel caught fire in the water off the coast of Latvia. The submarine was reported to have caught fire at about 1:30 a.m. on the morning of November 4, when it caught fire near the port of Krasnoyarsk in the Kaliningrad region of the Russian Federation. The vessel was carrying a crew of four, and the crew was not injured in the incident.

Mexican state oil company Pemex said 45 workers were injured in the blaze, which began early Wednesday morning. Two of them are in serious condition, the company said. Authorities evacuated about 300 people from the Abkatun Permanente platform after the fire started, Pemex said. At least 10 boats worked to battle the blaze for hours. The fire had been extinguished by Wednesday night, Pemex said in a Twitter post. The company denied rumors that the platform had collapsed and said there was no oil spill as a result of the fire. The state oil company hasn't said what caused the fire on the platform, which is located in the Gulf of Mexico's Campeche Sound. The fire began in the platform's dehydration and pumping area, Pemex said.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- A French-language global television network regained control of one of its 11 channels Thursday after a cyberattack a day earlier crippled its broadcasts and social media accounts. Television network TV5Monde was gradually regaining control of its channels and social media outlets after suffering what the network's director called an `` extremely powerful cyberattack. '' In addition to its 11 channels, TV5Monde lost control of its social media outlets and its websites, director Yves Bigot said in a video message posted later on Facebook. On a mobile site, which was still active, the network said it was `` hacked by an Islamist group. '' ISIS logos and markings appeared on TV5Monde social media accounts. But there was no immediate claim of responsibility by ISIS or any other group. As day broke Thursday in Europe, the network had regained the use of one of its 11 channels and its Facebook page, Paul Germain, the chain's editor in chief, told BFMTV, a CNN affiliate in France. However, by late morning, a number of pages on the network's website had messages saying they were under maintenance. The outage began around 8:45 p.m. Paris time -LRB- 2:45 p  CNN - RRB - CNN- RRB- CNN-RRB  The network said the attack was carried out by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Iraq and Syria. It said it had taken control of two of the channels and the social media sites of CNN and CNN-RBS.  In a statement posted on its website, CNN said that it had been attacked by an Islamic State (IS) militant group. It said that the attack had taken place in the city of Mosul in Iraq's Nineveh province and that it was the first time the group had been able to carry out such a large-scale attack on its own territory.  It said the attacks were carried out with the support of the Iraqi security forces. It added that the attacks had been carried out in coordination with the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF).  On Thursday, CNN reported that ISIS militants had taken

Boston -LRB- CNN -RRB- Guilty across the board. But will he face death? After deliberating for 11 1/2 hours, jurors found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on Wednesday of all 30 counts he faced in the Boston Marathon bombing trial. Seventeen of the 30 counts were capital charges, meaning he is eligible for the death penalty. The trial will next move into a penalty phase, where the jury will hear testimony and arguments from both sides and ultimately be tasked with deciding whether Tsarnaev, 21, will be executed. A look at all of the charges. Jurors will be asked to weigh aggravating factors such as the heinousness of his crimes against mitigating factors such as his family and mental health history, as well as his relative youth. Tsarnaev was 19 at the time of the bombing. The start date of the penalty phase has not yet been set. Since testimony began March 4, federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. It seemed a mismatch from the start. `` He was there, '' Tsarnaev's defense attorney Judy Clarke conceded as the trial opened, but many say the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life. Tsarnaev lawyer keeps hated criminals off death row. Clarke said the jury should be given the benefit of the doubt in deciding whether to sentence Tsarnaev to life in prison or life without parole. She said Tsarnaev's defense attorneys have been trying to convince the jury that he is innocent of all the charges he faces. The defense has said it will appeal the verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which is expected to rule on the appeal later this month. Tsarnaev's lawyers have said they will appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, which will hear the case next month. The jury will also have to decide whether Tsarnaev should be executed or not, and whether he should be put to death or not. Tsarnaev is scheduled to be back in court for a hearing on Thursday. He has been charged with first-degree murder, second-degree assault, and first- and third-degree attempted murder. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>
-LRB- CNN -RRB- A mammoth fire broke out Friday morning in a Kentucky industrial park, sending plumes of thick smoke over the area as authorities worked to contain the damage. The blaze began shortly before 7 a.m. at the General Electric Appliance Park in Louisville, according to Mike Weimer from the city's emergency management agency. He said that there were no reports of anyone injured or trapped. Video showed both smoke and bright orange flames. Firefighters took up positions around the affected buildings, spraying water from the periphery. Weimer told CNN that authorities didn't know what had caused the fire, which had gone to at least four alarms. According to a GE website, its facility in the Louisville Appliance Park is `` revitalizing manufacturing in the United States. '' The park is large, such that 34 football fields could fit in one of its warehouses in the facility. <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>This is the first of a two-part series on the history of the U.S. military.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- Do you remember the talk about plans for Iraqi-led force to try to take back Mosul this spring? Well, you might want to forget it. Nearly three months after a U.S. official said up to 25,000 Iraqis troops were expected to return to the key northern Iraqi city in April or May, a senior official in President Barack Obama's administration said Thursday that Washington is `` not putting a timeframe on '' a possible invasion. It `` might be some time from now. Might be soon, '' another senior administration official said. Mosul has long been the big prize in the Iraqi government's fight -- aided by a U.S.-led military coalition, which has carried out airstrikes for months -- to defeat ISIS. It has also long been a source of embarrassment, considering how it fell after Iraqi troops dropped their weapons, abandoned their posts and ran for their lives when militants arrived last June. The senior administration officials who talked to reporters Thursday stressed the Iraqis and their allies are making progress in their fight against the group that calls itself the Islamic State. In fact, officials insist that ISIS has been degraded substantially thanks to a combination of air power and ground combat. The biggest and most recent example of this came with the recapture of Mosul from ISIS in June, when Iraqi forces recaptured the city from the militants. The U.N. Security Council is expected to vote on a resolution this week that calls for an end to the fighting in the city and calls for the withdrawal of the Iraqi army from the city. The United States and its allies are also expected to hold a joint news conference in Baghdad on Thursday to discuss the situation in Mosul and the future of the city.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>
-LRB- CNN -RRB- The California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday said it is ordering Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to pay a record $ 1.6 billion penalty for unsafe operation of its gas transmission system, including the pipeline rupture that killed eight people in San Bruno in September 2010. Most of the penalty amounts to forced spending on improving pipeline safety. Of the $ 1.6 billion, $ 850 million will go to `` gas transmission pipeline safety infrastructure improvements, '' the commission said. Another $ 50 million will go toward `` other remedies to enhance pipeline safety, '' according to the commission. `` PG&E failed to uphold the public's trust, '' commission President Michael Picker said. `` The CPUC failed to keep vigilant. Lives were lost. Numerous people were injured. Homes were destroyed. We must do everything we can to ensure that nothing like this happens again. '' The company's chief executive officer said in a written statement that PG&E is working to become the safest energy company in the United States. `` Since the 2010 explosion of our natural gas transmission pipeline in San Bruno, we have worked hard to do the right thing for the victims, their families and the community of San Bruno, '' Tony Earley said. `` We are deeply saddened by the loss of life and are working with our partners to ensure the safety of our customers and our customers' homes and businesses. We will continue to work with our regulators to ensure our customers have the best possible experience with our products and services. We look forward to working with you in the coming days and weeks to make sure that our customers receive the best experience possible with our services and products. We are committed to providing our customers with the best service possible, and we will work with you to ensure your safety and well-being as we work to improve the quality of our service and products.''

The company said the deaths were the result of an accident that occurred at a gas station near the site of the explosion.  The company said in its statement that it is working with the California Department of
-LRB- CNN -RRB- In her 40 years living in Rochelle, Illinois, Cathy Olson had never seen a tornado that big. `` I saw the top of the funnel cloud, and it was absolutely massive, '' she said. She watched the hulking gray twister grind past her town Thursday, tearing up its fringes. Farther north, in the rural Illinois hamlet of Fairdale, one person died as a twister shredded homes and ripped trees bare of leaves and most limbs. Only the thickest branches remained standing. It was the only death reported so far in two days of tornado touchdowns. Rochelle was fortunate. But in nearby Kirkland, debris was so thick on the roads, responders searching for trapped residents could not yet assess the damage or injuries, fire officials said. On Thursday, a video surfaced on YouTube of a massive twister barreling across an open field, barely missing farmhouses and barns. Images of the funnel turned up elsewhere on social media. Multiple tornadoes ripped through the rural Midwest on Thursday. A large and dangerous twister tore across fields in Iowa. And a twister touched down 70 miles outside of St. Louis. Eight tornadoes were reported Wednesday in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, the National Weather Service said in a statement. The twister was the largest tornado to hit the U.S. in more than a decade, and the second-largest to strike the Midwest in a single day. The tornado was a Category 4 storm, and was the second to strike in the Midwest this year, the NWS said. The NWS also said the tornado was the third-largest tornado ever recorded in the United States. The National Hurricane Center said Thursday that the twister had a maximum sustained wind speed of 185 miles per hour and was moving at an average speed of 90 mph. It also said it was the fourth-largest twister ever recorded by the NHC. The NHC said it had not yet been able to determine the cause of the tornado, but said it could have been caused by a natural phenomenon. The tornado is the second of its kind in the country, after a tornado in New Orleans that killed at least 50
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Eyewitness video showing white North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager shooting to death an unarmed black man has exposed discrepancies in the reports of the first officers on the scene. Slager has been fired and charged with murder in the death of 50-year-old Walter Scott. A bystander's cell phone video, which began after an alleged struggle on the ground between Slager and Scott, shows the five-year police veteran shooting at Scott eight times as Scott runs away. Scott was hit five times. If words were exchanged between the men, they're are not audible on the tape. It's unclear what happened before Scott ran, or why he ran. The officer initially said that he used a Taser on Scott, who, Slager said, tried to take the weapon. Before Slager opens fire, the video shows a dark object falling behind Scott and hitting the ground. It's unclear whether that is the Taser. Later in the video, when Slager approaches Scott's body, Slager appears to drop a dark object near Scott. Slager is seen in the video handcuffing Scott after the shooting. Witness : I nearly erased shooting video out of fear. Feidin Santana, the officer who shot and killed Scott, told the Charleston Gazette-Mail that Slager's death was a'mistake' and that he 'didn't know what to do with it. He said that Scott was unarmed when he was shot. He also said that the officer had a gun in his hand when he fired the fatal shot. Santana said that when he saw the video of the shooting, he thought it was a mistake. He added that the video was'very disturbing' to him and that 'it was very disturbing to me to see a police officer shoot a black man in the back of the head with a gun... It was a very disturbing thing to see..."  .  Santana, who is white, told the Gazette Mail that the shooting was 'a mistake'.  He added that he thought Slager had a weapon in his hands when he shot the unarmed man. Santana also
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Police in India are putting aside their batons in favor of an overhead solution to angry and unruly crowds : pepper-spraying drones. Yashasvi Yadav, Senior Superintendent of police in Lucknow, northern India, told CNN the city's force has bought four drones and is in the process of purchasing one more. `` The drones have been tested in controlled conditions, '' he said. `` They have been very successful and will be used by the Lucknow police whenever there are violent protests or mob attacks. '' The miniature aircraft will be fitted with a camera and pepper spray ; each drone costs between $ 9,560 and $ 19,300, Yadav added. Views on the new measure are mixed, with some concerned about the suppression of freedom of speech -- an already contentious issue in India. Last month, the country failed to enforce a law that would allow authorities to arrest people who post offensive material on social media. Others believe the country could learn from events further afield. Some say this method of crowd control needs regulation too. Questions have also been raised as to why the police are resorting to aggression. `` While I think it is bound to fail if not be another scam in the making, it also raises the question of whether the police will be able to keep up with the demands of the people who are protesting against the government's policies and actions. The government has made it clear that it does not want to be seen as a threat to the security of its citizens. It has also said that it will not interfere in any way in the functioning of the police force or in the operation of any other law enforcement agency in the country. The police have also said they will not use force against anyone who is protesting against their government policies or actions.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Just as the agency begins to recover from a series of high-profile missteps, the Secret Service is facing yet another scandal. A female employee accused Xavier Morales, a supervisor within the agency, of assault after he made sexual advances at her, according to The Washington Post. `` The woman told police and agency investigators that Morales, her boss, told her during the party at Capitol City Brewing Company that he was in love with her and would like to have sex with her, '' and later tried to kiss her in the office, according to a report from The Washington Post. During the incident, he `` grabbed her arms when she resisted '' and the two tussled until Morales gave up, sources told the paper. The Post reports that the March 31 party was in celebration of Morales'new assignment as head of the Louisville field office. A Secret Service spokesperson confirms that Morales was placed on administrative leave and his security clearance was suspended. This incident was first reported on April 2, and Secret Service Director Joe Clancy was briefed that afternoon. Clancy called the allegations `` very disturbing. '' `` Any threats or violence that endangers our employees in the workplace is unacceptable and will not be tolerated, '' he said in a statement. This is just the latest in a string of incidents in which Secret Service employees have been accused of sexual harassment or assault. The Secret Service has been under fire for its handling of sexual misconduct allegations in recent years, including allegations that it mishandled sexual assault cases in the 1980s and '90s. The agency has also been criticized for failing to protect its employees from sexual harassment and assault allegations, including one in which a Secret Service officer was accused of groping a female Secret Service agent during a break-in at the agency's headquarters in Washington, D.C.. In the past, Secret Service agents have been charged with sexual misconduct in the course of their duties, but the agency has not yet charged any of its employees with any of the charges. The agency's chief of staff, James O'Neill, has said that the agency will not tolerate sexual harassment of Secret Service personnel and that it will continue to investigate the allegations.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>
-LRB- The Hollywood Reporter -RRB- Richard Dysart, the Emmy-winning actor who portrayed the cranky senior partner Leland McKenzie in the slick, long-running NBC drama `` L.A. Law, '' has died. He was 86. Dysart, who also played Coach in the original 1972 Broadway production of Jason Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning `` That Championship Season, '' died Sunday at home in Santa Monica after a long illness, his wife, artist Kathryn Jacobi, told The Hollywood Reporter. The acclaimed `` L.A. Law '' -- created by Steven Bochco -LRB- who eventually handed off the series to David E. Kelley -RRB- and Terry Louise Fisher -- aired for eight seasons from 1986 to 1994. For playing the founder of the firm McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak, Dysart was nominated for the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for four straight years, finally winning the trophy in 1992. `` I always had him in mind for that role, '' Bochco said in a 2002 interview with the Archive of American Television. `` He's so avuncular. So I reached out to him. You know, Dick is sort of an old hippie guy. He's got a lot of charisma and he's a great actor. He's a good friend of mine. He was a great friend to me. He had a great relationship with me. I think he had a lot to do with it. I don't know if it was a personal thing or a business thing, but I think it was an emotional thing. It was a very personal thing for him. I mean, he was very close to me. I think that was a big part of it. It's hard to say, but it was very personal for him. It was very emotional for me. And it was also a very emotional thing for his family. It's a very sad day for the family of Leland and his wife and their children. I'm very sad to hear that he's gone. I hope he's not going to be around for a long time. I wish him all the best in his
-LRB- CNN -RRB- You may know Mindy Kaling from Fox's cult hit comedy `` The Mindy Project, '' in which she plays Mindy Lahiri, a perky, quirky OB/GYN juggling her career and love life in New York. -LRB- Only in the Big Apple can a doctor not afford an apartment! -RRB-. The show was a breakthrough for on-screen representation -- the first network sitcom created by and starring a woman of color -- and it looks likely to be renewed for the coming 2015-16 season. Recently, however, Kaling's brother Vijay Chokalingam unveiled a project of his own, and while it has been getting a lot of attention, it hasn't generated quite as many laughs -- either from observers or from his famous sibling, who told him it brought `` shame upon their family. '' You see, Chokalingam revealed that, as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, he engaged in a daring -LRB- his view -RRB- or ridiculous and offensive -LRB- pretty much everyone else -RRB- scam : He applied to medical school claiming to be African-American. Chokalingam had spent his college years working as an intern at a local hospital, and he had just graduated from college with a bachelor's degree in psychology. He had just finished his master's degree and was looking for a job as an assistant professor at a private university. He wanted to be a doctor, but he didn't have a doctorate in psychology, so he decided to pursue a career in medicine. He applied for a position as a clinical assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center, where he had worked as a psychiatrist for more than 20 years. He was offered a position at the hospital, but decided against it because of the stigma attached to being a doctor. He went on to work as a professor of psychiatry at Columbia Medical Center, where he received a Ph.D. in psychiatry from Columbia University's School of Medicine. He was then hired as a consultant to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in Bethesda, Maryland, where
-LRB- CNN -RRB- `` A long, long, time ago... '' Those five words, when uttered or sung, makes baby boomers immediately think of Don McLean's pop masterpiece `` American Pie. '' It's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8 1/2 minute allegory, which millions of Americans know by heart, is 44 years old. All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song, brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus, which starts as `` Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie. '' There is no real way to categorize McLean's `` American Pie '' for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock. On Tuesday, Christie's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song's lyrics for $ 1.2 million to an unnamed buyer. McLean was a paperboy when, on February 3, 1959, he saw that Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. `` The Big Bopper '' Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa. `` The next day I went to school in shock and guess what? '' McLean recalled. `` Nobody cared. Rock 'n' roll was the only thing that mattered to him. He was a rock star. He had a lot of money and he was a big star. But he didn't care. He just wanted to be famous. He didn't want to be in the limelight. He wanted to make a name for himself. And he wanted to do it. He did it because he knew he was going to make it big. He knew he could do it, and he did it for the right reasons. And that's what he did. He made it big, and that's why he made it. It was his way of saying, 'I'm going to do what I want to do, and I'm not going to let anybody else do it for me. I'm just going to go out there and do it.' '' The song was written by Buddy Holly's father, Buddy McLean, who died in a plane crash in
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Anthony Ray Hinton is thankful to be free after nearly 30 years on Alabama's death row for murders he says he didn't commit. And incredulous that it took so long. Hinton, 58, looked up, took in the sunshine and thanked God and his lawyers Friday morning outside the county jail in Birmingham, minutes after taking his first steps as a free man since 1985. He spoke of unjustly losing three decades of his life, under fear of execution, for something he didn't do. `` All they had to do was to test the gun, but when you think you're high and mighty and you're above the law, you don't have to answer to nobody, '' Hinton told reporters. `` But I've got news for you -- everybody that played a part in sending me to death row, you will answer to God. '' Jefferson County Circuit Court Judge Laura Petro had ordered Hinton released after granting the state's motion to dismiss charges against him. Hinton was convicted of murder in the 1985 deaths of two Birmingham-area, fast-food restaurant managers, John Davidson and Thomas Wayne Vason. But a new trial was ordered in 2014 after firearms experts testified 12 years ago that Hinton did not commit the murders. Hinton's lawyers argued that the state had failed to prove that he committed the murders because he did not have a gun. The judge ruled that the evidence did not support the state's contention that he killed Davidson and Vason because he didn't have a firearm. The trial was scheduled to begin in January 2015. The state appealed the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in 2015 that the trial court erred in denying Hinton a fair trial. The appeals court said the state failed to show that he had a gun in his possession when he killed Vason and Davidson. The court also said Hinton had a concealed carry permit and that he was not required to carry a concealed weapon in his home. The state argued that because Hinton didn't carry a gun, he could not be held responsible for the killings because he had not been convicted of a crime. The appeals

She was a married 34-year-old teacher and mother of four in Seattle in 1996 when she began an affair with Fualaau, her 13-year-old student.

-LRB- The Hollywood Reporter -RRB- `` Grace of Monaco, '' starring Nicole Kidman as star-turned-princess Grace Kelly, is heading straight to Lifetime. The critically-panned film, which opened last year's Cannes Film Festival, will premiere on Lifetime on Memorial Day, May 25. After the movie performed poorly in its international engagements, The Weinstein Co., which first purchased U.S. distribution rights at the 2013 Berlin Film Festival, decided to sell it directly to Lifetime rather than book it into U.S. theaters, a source confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. THR : Grace of Monaco'Cannes review. The film, which was directed by Olivier Dahan and focuses on a period in the early '60s when Monaco was involved in a stand-off over taxes with France and Grace was contemplating a return to Hollywood, was originally scheduled for release in late 2013. Given the names involved, some handicappers had put it on their list of potential Oscar contenders. But when TWC pulled it out of awards contention and shifted its release to March 14, 2014, Dahan lashed out at TWC's Harvey Weinstein, over the movie's final cut, which the director was in the process of completing. `` There are a lot of people out there who want to see this movie,'' Dahan told THR. '' I don't think it's going to happen. It's not going to be a big deal. I think it will be a huge hit. It will be the biggest hit of the year. I'm not saying it won't happen, but I'm saying it's a big hit, and I'm going to make it happen.'' Dahan also said that the film would be a hit in the U.K. and that it would be the first time the studio had ever made a feature film in the United States. He said that he was not sure if he would be able to make the film in time for the Oscars, but that he would have to wait and see if he could make it in time to win the Oscar. Dahan said he would like to see the film make it to the big screen, but that it was too early
-LRB- CNN -RRB- That's some rich `` American Pie. '' The lyrics to the famed Don McLean song sold for $ 1.2 million Tuesday morning at an auction held by Christie's. `` Don McLean's manuscript of ` American Pie'achieved the 3rd highest auction price for an American literary manuscript, a fitting tribute to one the foremost singer-songwriters of his generation, '' Christie's Tom Lecky said in a statement. McLean told Rolling Stone that it was time to part with the manuscript. `` I'm going to be 70 this year, '' the singer and songwriter said in February. `` I have two children and a wife, and none of them seem to have the mercantile instinct. I want to get the best deal that I can for them. It's time. '' Over the years, `` American Pie '' has become one of the most dissected and argued-about songs in the pop music canon. McLean has said that the opening lines were inspired by the death of Buddy Holly, but after that, it's all been conjecture -- which hasn't stopped a marching band's worth of analysts from trying to parse the symbols in the 8-minute, 2-minute and 3-minute versions of the song. The song was written by McLean in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when he was in his early 30s, and it was written with the help of a friend of McLean's who had worked with him in the '60s and '70s. The lyrics were written in a way that McLean would have liked, but he didn't want it to sound like he was trying to sell the song to a group of people who didn't like it. He wanted it to be a tribute to a man who had died in a car accident, and he wanted to make sure that it didn't sound like the song was being sold to the wrong people. '' McLean said in an interview with Rolling Stone, '' I don't want to sell it to anybody. I want people to know that I'm not selling it to anyone. I'm just trying to make

The photographer, Daniel Ramos, had filed the civil suit against West after the hip-hop star attacked him and tried to wrestle his camera from him in July 2013 at Los Angeles International Airport. West pleaded no contest last year to a misdemeanor count of battery over the scuffle. A judge sentenced him to two years'probation, as well as anger management sessions and community service. Ramos and his lawyer, Gloria Allred, sought general and punitive damages in the civil suit, saying that West had interfered with the photographer's rights to pursue a lawful occupation. The case had been set for trial next week, but Allred issued a statement Tuesday night saying Ramos'side had filed a dismissal `` because the case was settled to the satisfaction of the parties. '' She didn't disclose the details of the settlement other than saying that `` one important aspect of it was an apology by Kanye West to our client, Daniel Ramos. '' Her statement included a picture of West and Ramos shaking hands, which she said happened after the apology. The original incident was caught on video, including the following exchange. `` Kanye! Kanye! I'm so sorry for what you did to me. I'm sorry for everything you've done to me and my family.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- Buzz has surrounded HBO's new documentary `` Going Clear : Scientology and the Prison of Belief, '' but Scientologist John Travolta is not a fan. Travolta told the Tampa Bay Times that he has not seen the documentary, `` and I don't really care to. '' `` I've been so happy with my -LRB- Scientology -RRB- experience in the last 40 years that I really don't have anything to say that would shed light on -LRB- a documentary -RRB- so decidedly negative, '' Travolta said. The actor, one of the Church of Scientology's most high-profile members along with stars like Tom Cruise and Kirstie Alley, is premiering his new film, `` The Forger, '' in Clearwater, Florida. The HBO documentary is based on the book `` Going Clear : Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief '' by Lawrence Wright and is critical of the organization, which has close ties to the showbiz industry. Travolta said he believed the doc was a result of `` people who were disgruntled with their experiences '' with the Church of Scientology, which he touted as a positive experience for him. He said that he was not surprised by the documentary's negative portrayal of the church and its leaders. `` I don't think I've ever seen anything like it,'' he said. `` It's not a documentary, it's a documentary about the church. It's about a group of people who are trying to get out of Scientology, and they're trying to find a way out of it. I think that's what's going on here. I'm not going to tell you what it is, but I think it's going to be very interesting to see how it plays out in the future.'' He added that the documentary is not intended to be a documentary on the church or its leaders, but rather a way for people to learn more about the organization and how it operates. He said he hopes the documentary will help people learn about the Church and its leadership. `` The documentary is going to give people a better understanding of what Scientology is all about
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Blues legend B.B. King was hospitalized for dehydration, though the ailment didn't keep him out for long. King's dehydration was caused by his Type II diabetes, but he `` is much better, '' his daughter, Claudette King, told the Los Angeles Times. The legendary guitarist and vocalist released a statement thanking those who have expressed their concerns. `` I'm feeling much better and am leaving the hospital today, '' King said in a message Tuesday. Angela Moore, a publicist for Claudette King, said later in the day that he was back home resting and enjoying time with his grandchildren. `` He was struggling before, and he is a trouper, '' Moore said. `` He wasn't going to let his fans down. '' No more information on King's condition or where he was hospitalized was immediately available. B.B. is short for Blues Boy, part of the name he used as a Memphis disc jockey, the Beale Street Blues Boy. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, and has 30 Grammy nominations. King, 89, has used various models of Gibson guitars over the years, and named each one of them Lucille. He was born in Memphis, Tennessee, on May 6, 1883, and moved to New York City with his family when he was a child. He moved to Los Angeles with his wife and three children in the mid-1970s, when he moved back to Memphis, where he worked as an electrician.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- Rebekah Gregory blinked back tears as she thought about the verdict. It had been almost two years since Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother planted bombs at the Boston Marathon, setting off deadly explosions that wounded her and hundreds of others. In court last month, she testified that one of the blasts on that day in 2013 left her lying in the street, staring at her own bones. Now, jurors have found him guilty on all 30 counts he faced for the deadly bombings and their aftermath. But no verdict can ever totally make up for the pain, she said. `` I don't believe that there will ever be justice brought to this, no mater if he does get the death penalty or he remains in prison for the rest of his life, '' she said, crying as she spoke to reporters outside her Texas home. `` I do believe, however, that he should be held accountable for his actions. And I'm very thankful for each of the jury members that are making him do that. '' Gregory, who wrote a widely publicized letter to Tsarnaev after testifying, said the trial has left her and other victims reeling from a flood of emotions as they relive horrifying memories, but it's an important step. `` This is a very difficult time for me and my family, and I want to make it clear that I am not going to let this happen again. I am going to do everything in my power to make sure that justice is done for the victims and their families. I will continue to fight for the rights of all of the people who have lost loved ones in this senseless act of senseless violence. And I will do everything I can to help those who have been affected by this tragedy, and I will work with the families of those who lost their loved ones to do the same. I hope that the jury will find that Mr. Tsarnaev did not commit any of the crimes that he was charged with, and that he will not be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. But I also hope that justice will be done for those who were affected by the events of the last few days, and for all those who are still grieving. I

Bi Fujian, who works for state-run China Central Television, was filmed at a dinner party singing a revolutionary song that eulogizes the Communist Party's early years when he started going off script. `` The Communist Party, Chairman Mao. Don't mention that old son of a b *** h. He made us suffer so bad, '' went Bi's improvised lyrics. The other dinner guests burst into laughter. Bi later apologized. `` My personal speech has led to grave social consequences, and I feel remorseful for that. I hereby sincerely apologize to the public. As a public figure, I shall learn the lesson from this incident, adhering to strict self-discipline, '' he posted on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform. Making disrespectful references to China's leaders in public is considered a taboo in China, even today. And Bi's comment was directed at the man regarded by many as the country's founding father -- despite his controversial reputation. The 75-second video clip, seemingly filmed on the cellphone of his wife, was posted on the Weibo microblogging site. The video has since been taken down, but the video has been viewed more than 1.5 million times on the social media site. In the video, Bi is heard saying: `` I am the leader of the People's Republic of China. I am not afraid of the people. I will not be afraid of anyone. I do not want to be a dictator. I don't want the people to see me as a tyrant. I want them to know that I am a good person and that I will do what is right for the people of this country. I have never been afraid of anybody. I believe that the people have a right to know who I am and what I stand for. If they do not know, then they will not know me. I hope that they will learn from this mistake. I apologize to all the people who have been hurt by this video
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Tornado sirens blared Wednesday night in Kansas as several storms brought reports of twisters. Spotters reported a tornado about 6 miles northwest of Goddard, which is less than 15 miles west of Wichita. That storm moved to the northeast, missing the city, but posing potential risks to other communities. `` There will be storms... that pop up all night long, '' said CNN severe weather expert Chad Myers. `` Nighttime tornadoes are the most deadly, are the most dangerous. '' Other reports of tornadoes came in from southwestern Kansas, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Three of the sightings were near Aetna, 125 miles southwest of Wichita. Kansas wasn't the only state affected by the storms. The National Weather Service indicated a tornado may have touched down in the small town of Potosi, Missouri, about 70 miles from St. Louis. CNN affiliate KMOV reported that it had received reports of wind damage and flooding in the town. One Instagram user there posted a photo of a fallen tree. Aerial footage also showed damage to roofs and one street overtaken by water. Not far away from Potosi, Shyler and Christin Strube in Leadington posted an Instagram picture of some unusual dark clouds. And a Twitter user posted a picture of a tornado that had been spotted in the area. The tornado was reported to have hit about 10 miles southeast of Wichita on Wednesday night.

With two hooves sticking out for several minutes in the midst of labor? Luckily, Katie -- a giraffe at the Dallas Zoo -- is a champ. In an hour-long labor captured by 10 cameras and streamed live by Animal Planet, Katie gave birth to a not-so-little baby -LRB- about 6 feet tall -RRB- early Friday evening. There was no immediate word on the newborn's gender or condition. But there were good signs, as seen on the live stream and Dallas Zoo's Twitter feed -- like its ears moving, its efforts to stand, and its nursing -LRB- or at least trying to nurse -RRB- from mom. `` We're so proud, '' the zoo tweeted. The newcomer's debut was a long time coming, especially when you count for Katie's 15-month gestation period -- average for a giraffe, according to Animal Planet. The baby joins a sister, 4-year-old calf Jamie. It wasn't immediately known how many people online saw Katie go into labor, but it was reported that she was in labor for about an hour and a half. The zoo posted a photo of the baby on its Facebook page, where it was captioned, `` We are so proud, Katie, we are so excited to have you as our new baby. We hope you will be a part of our family for the rest of your life. We will miss you so much, and we will be so proud of you.'' The zoo also posted a picture of the newborn on its Twitter page, with the caption, `` Thank you for all the love and support you have given us over the years. We look forward to seeing you in the future. We wish you the best of luck in your new life.''<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

-LRB- CNN -RRB- The VII Summit of the Americas was supposed to be all about the symbolic handshake between the United States and Cuba. But insert Venezuela into the mix and Panama City, Panama, quickly turns into a `` triangle of tension. '' Heads of state from 35 countries in the Western Hemisphere have met every three years to discuss economic, social or political issues since the creation of the summit in 1994. Cuba has historically been the wrench in the diplomatic machinery, with some Latin American leaders threatening not to attend the Summit of the Americas if the United States and Canada didn't agree to invite President Raul Castro. The tide changed December 17, 2014, when President Barack Obama and Castro announced that more than five decades of Cold War rivalry was ending. Diplomats from both countries immediately began negotiations to establish embassies in Havana and Washington, and the attention immediately focused on the Summit of the Americas, where for the first time since the about-face, Obama and Castro would come face-to-face. The much anticipated handshake between Obama and Castro would steal all the headlines if it wasn't for Cuba's strongest ally, Venezuela. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro recently accused the United States of trying to topple his government and banned former President George Bush, former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice from attending the summit. The U.S. Embassy in Havana has been closed for more than a year, and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is scheduled to meet with Cuban Foreign Minister Ricardo Patrícia on Thursday to discuss the matter. The meeting is expected to take place in Washington, D.C., and will be attended by President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, as well as Vice President Biden and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, who will also attend the summit. The meeting will be held at the United Nations headquarters in New York City, where Obama and the Vice President will meet with the Cuban Foreign Ministry and the Cuban Ambassador to the U.K.. The two leaders will also meet in Havana for a joint press conference on Thursday, where they will discuss Cuba's economic and political situation. The summit will be the first of its kind in
-LRB- CNN -RRB- The outlines of a nuclear deal with Iran are in place. Unfortunately, it seems like too many in President Barack Obama's administration have forgotten that the only reason this terrorist-supporting state came to the negotiating table in the first place was because of tough sanctions imposed by the U.S. Congress. Indeed, the reality is that President Obama is giving up enormous leverage in his nuclear deal with Iran -- and I worry we will lose it for good. Bleeding money, and faced with falling oil prices, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei gave his government rare permission to bargain with the `` Great Satan '' -- the United States. But just as U.S. and European sanctions were forcing Iran to the nuclear crossroads, President Obama has given Tehran an easy exit. For Khamenei, the `` framework '' announced last week looks like a win-win : He gets to keep his nuclear infrastructure, and in return gets billions of dollars in sanctions relief. Congress offered a better strategy when the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel, and I introduced a bill to hit Tehran with its toughest sanctions yet. Unfortunately, this bill -- which passed the House in a 400-20 vote -- was blocked in the Senate last year by a vote of 60-45. The bill would have required Iran to pay $1.5 billion in fines to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and $1 billion in penalties to the European Union and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IAEA and the I.M.F. would have to agree on a new deal that would allow Iran to continue to develop its nuclear program. But the deal would have allowed Iran to keep its nuclear weapons program in the hands of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which would have prevented Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The I.C.'s decision would have made it clear that Iran would not be able to obtain a nuclear weapons capability without a deal with the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which has jurisdiction over Iran's nuclear program. In other words, Iran would have been able to continue its nuclear enrichment program without the ICJ's approval. The I
Waterloo, Iowa -LRB- CNN -RRB- Martin O'Malley and Jim Webb share little in common. Both Democrats are toying with a presidential run, both are facing long odds in that endeavor, and both shared a stage at the Polk County Democrats Awards Dinner in Des Moines, Iowa, on Friday night. But, as was evident at the dinner, that is where the similarities end. O'Malley is a former mayor and Maryland governor who seems most at home when he is pressing the flesh at events and introducing himself to anyone who would extend their hand. Webb, on the contrary, is a decorated Vietnam War veteran and former senator from Virginia who comes across as more stoic and, at times, uncomfortable with retail politics. Before the event, O'Malley confidently cruised the union hall. He took selfies with young environmental activists and chatted with sometimes tepid supporters who admitted their other political allegiances. `` It is a marathon, not a sprint, '' one man told O'Malley, a nod to his long odds in the 2016 Democratic nomination process. `` Yes, it is ; it's a marathon, '' O'Malley responded. `` Welcome to Iowa, '' said another man. `` We hope to see you here more. We hope you will join us on the campaign trail. We are going to do everything we can to help you win the nomination. We will do everything possible to make sure that you are elected president of the United States of America. And we will do all we can for you... We have a lot of work to do. We have to do it. And we have to win this election. We can't wait to see what you do with your life and your family and your friends and your neighbors and your businesses and your children and your grandchildren and your great-grandchildren and your sons and daughters and your granddaughters and great-great-granddaughters. We need you to do all you can to make this happen. We cannot wait for you to be elected president. We must do everything in our power to make it happen. And if we don't do it, we will not be able to win the White House.
Charleston, South Carolina -LRB- CNN -RRB- Police officers Saturday accompanied the hearse carrying the body of Walter Scott to his South Carolina funeral service, where hundreds of mourners celebrated his life and death as a catalyst for change in America. A pair of officers on motorcycles were part of the large procession delivering the father of four -- who was fatally shot in the back by a police officer -- to a service open to the public. An overflow crowd gathered on a humid and occasionally rainy April afternoon at W.O.R.D. Ministries Christian Center in Summerville, which has a capacity of about 300 people. The flag-draped casket of the U.S. Coast Guard veteran was wheeled inside the church as Scott's relatives and friends followed. Some dabbed tears ; others embraced. Hundreds, including local officials, assembled inside the packed sanctuary -- in corridors, under an awning at the entrance, wherever they could stand. Silence filled the vast space as Scott's daughter Samantha read a poem of love dedicated to her father. Anthony Scott said God had selected his brother as a candidate for change in America. `` The change will come, '' he said, bringing to the crowd to its feet. The head of the church, the Rev. Dr. Robert E. Lee, said he was praying for Scott's family and friends to come together to pray for him and his loved ones. He said Scott's death was an example of the power of prayer and the importance of prayer in the lives of people who are struggling to make a difference in the world. The Rev. Robert Lee said Scott was an inspiration to many people in his community and that his death was a reminder of how important it is for people of faith and faith-based organizations to pray together for their loved ones and their families. He added that Scott was a hero to many in his church and that he would be missed by all who knew him. Scott was born in South Carolina, where he was raised by his mother and father. His father died in a car accident while he was a child, and his mother died when he was 10 years old. He was a member of the South Carolina Baptist Church
Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- Washington was rocked late Thursday by shootings -- one at the gates of the U.S. Census Bureau's headquarters and another in a popular area packed with restaurant patrons. The shootings were connected, authorities said. They began with what authorities believe was a domestic kidnapping incident, according to D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier. The suspect's vehicle was spotted outside the Census Bureau, which is in Suitland, Maryland. A guard apparently approached the vehicle and saw two people arguing. That guard was then shot at least once in the upper body, said Prince George's County Fire Department spokesman Mark Brady. The guard was in extremely critical condition, according to Brady. The police chief said the suspect then fled the scene. Officers picked up the chase, and the suspect fired gunshots at multiple locations, Lanier said. The chase ended in a crash on Washington's busy H Street. A shootout ensues, Lanier said. An officer and the suspect were wounded, according to the police chief. Both were conscious and talking when they left the scene. `` Right now, we have every reason to believe that the car that we have in this last incident here is the same car involved and the same person involved in the shooting," Lanier told reporters. The shooting was the latest in a string of shootings in the city that have left at least three people dead and more than 100 injured. Police have said they are investigating the shooting as a possible hate crime.  RAW Paste Data  WASHINGTON - LRB-CNN- CNN-RRB - Washington was shaken late Thursday night by shootings," authorities said. The suspects were spotted inside a popular neighborhood packed with eateries. The suspects, who were in their early 20s or early 30s, were seen fleeing the scene in a white pickup truck. Police said the suspects were armed with assault rifles and handguns. The driver of the truck was taken into custody and charged with first-degree murder. Police also said they believe the suspect was involved in a domestic violence incident. The man was taken to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police are asking anyone with information about the shooting to call the
Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- An Iranian military observation aircraft flew within 50 yards of an armed U.S. Navy helicopter over the Persian Gulf this month, sparking concern that top Iranian commanders might not be in full control of local forces, CNN has learned. The incident, which has not been publicly disclosed, troubled U.S. military officials because the unsafe maneuver could have triggered a serious incident. It also surprised U.S. commanders because in recent months Iranian forces have conducted exercises and operations in the region in a professional manner, one U.S. military official told CNN. `` We think this might have been locally ordered, '' the official said. The incident took place as the U.S. and other world powers meet with Iran in Switzerland to negotiate a deal limiting Tehran's nuclear program. At the same time, Iran has been active in supporting proxies in several hotspots in the Persian Gulf and neighboring regions. The Navy MH-60R armed helicopter was flying from the deck of the USS Carl Vinson on a routine patrol in international airspace, the official said. An unarmed Iranian observation Y-12 aircraft approached. The Iranian aircraft made two passes at the helicopter, coming within 50 yards, before the helicopter moved off, according to the official. The official said the Iranian aircraft had been flying for about an hour and a half before the aircraft made its approach, and that the aircraft had not been in contact with the Iranian military. The aircraft flew over the Gulf of Oman for about two hours before the Iranian helicopter made its move. The U.N. Security Council has called for an immediate halt to Iran's nuclear program, and the United Nations Security Council will hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday to discuss the situation in the Gulf region. Iran has denied any involvement in the incident, saying it was an accident and that it did not intend to harm the United States or its allies. The United States and its allies have been pressing Iran to halt its nuclear program and to stop its ballistic missile program, but Iranian officials have said they have no plans to do so. Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a statement on Tuesday that the incident was not an accident, but that it was
New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- When Liana Barrientos was 23 years old, she got married in Westchester County, New York. A year later, she got married again in Westchester County, but to a different man and without divorcing her first husband. Only 18 days after that marriage, she got hitched yet again. Then, Barrientos declared `` I do '' five more times, sometimes only within two weeks of each other. In 2010, she married once more, this time in the Bronx. In an application for a marriage license, she stated it was her `` first and only '' marriage. Barrientos, now 39, is facing two criminal counts of `` offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree, '' referring to her false statements on the 2010 marriage license application, according to court documents. Prosecutors said the marriages were part of an immigration scam. On Friday, she pleaded not guilty at State Supreme Court in the Bronx, according to her attorney, Christopher Wright, who declined to comment further. After leaving court, Barrientos was arrested and charged with theft of service and criminal trespass for allegedly sneaking into the New York subway through an emergency exit, said Detective Annette Markowski, a police spokeswoman. In addition, she was charged with making a false statement to a police officer, and for making false statements to the police officer's supervisor, Markowski said. She was released on $100,000 bail and is scheduled to appear in court on Monday.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

-LRB- CNN -RRB- I remember the day I stopped praying. It was the day after my little brother, Jimmy, died of cancer. He was 25. I was so angry at God. I was 27 at the time, and, like most young people I had stopped going to church. But, on that day -- that terrible day -- I desperately needed to understand why God took my brother. I called the nearest Catholic church, looking for a priest. A lady picked up the phone. `` Can I talk with Father? '' I asked. I wish I could say her answer was `` yes. '' Instead, she asked me if I was a member of that particular parish. `` Does it matter? '' I asked. -LRB- At the time I lived far from my home parish. -RRB- I don't remember how she responded, but the answer about my being able to see Father was clearly no. I don't know if all Catholic churches would have shut me out, but I figured, at the time, it was part of the long list of rules the Vatican required Catholic leaders to follow. I cried for a bit, then decided I would never ask God for anything. Clearly, his conduits on Earth did not allow me to ask him for anything, and I had no idea what to do with myself. So I went back to my church, where I had been baptized, and began to pray. I prayed for a few minutes, and then I prayed again, and again, until I finally got to the point where I could no longer see Father. The next day, I went to the church again, this time to see if I could talk with him. He told me that I was not allowed to talk to him. I told him that I did not want to go to church with him, and that I wanted to talk with God. He said that he would not let me talk to Father. I said that I would not talk to God, and he said that if I did, he would let me go. I asked him if he could talk to me again, but he said no. He then told me to go back to church
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Mullah Mohammed Omar is `` still the leader '' of the Taliban's self-declared Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. That appears to be the primary message of a biography, just published by the Taliban, of the reclusive militant who is credited with founding the group in the early 1990s. The Taliban's `` Cultural Commission '' released the 11-page document in several different translations on the movement's website, ostensibly to commemorate the 19th anniversary of an April 4, 1996, meeting in Afghanistan's Kandahar province when an assembly of Afghans swore allegiance to Omar. Several Afghan observers say the biography is aimed at dispelling rumors of Omar's demise. `` There have been a lot of rumors lately about him. Some people are saying that he is not alive, '' said Sayyed Muhammad Akbar Agha, a former Taliban insider who has written an autobiography about his days with the movement. `` I think the Taliban thought it was an important time to release his biography to give assurances that he is alive and present, '' Agha told CNN in a telephone interview. Bergen : Why U.S. must stay in Afghanistan past 2016. The biography also appears to be an attempt to remind the world of Omar ''s role in the Taliban ''s rise to power in the 1990s and early 2000s, when he was the leader of the group. The biography was first published in the New York Times on April 4, 1996, and has since been translated into more than 100 languages. The book was published in English and in several other languages in the United States and other countries. The Taliban has said that the biography was intended to show that Omar was not dead and that he was not a member of the terrorist group, but that he had been in Afghanistan for a long time and had been involved in a number of terrorist activities. The Afghan government has denied that Omar had been killed or that his death was a result of his involvement with the Taliban. In a statement to CNN, the Taliban said that it had no knowledge of the biography and that it would not comment further on the matter. In an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Omar
-LRB- CNN -RRB- An Amnesty International report is calling for authorities to address the number of attacks on women's rights activists in Afghanistan. The report, entitled `` Their Lives on the Line, '' examines the persecution of activists and other champions of women's rights not only by the Taliban and tribal warlords, but also by government officials. Its publication is timely. The brutal murder of Farkhunda, a young woman in Afghanistan, whose body was burnt and callously chucked into a river in Kabul, shocked the world. Accused of burning pages from the Muslim holy book, the Quran, many protested the 27-year-old's innocence. But what also made international headlines was the fact that for the first time in history, women in Afghanistan became pallbearers, hoisting the victim's coffin on their shoulders draped with headscarves, under the gazes of men ; unreservedly sobbing and shouting messages of women's solidarity as they marched along the streets. In a country ranked in 2011 by a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll as the most dangerous place in the world for women, this feminist act seemed perilous. Latest figures suggest they were risking their lives to be heard. In 2013, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) reported that more than 1,000 women had been killed in violence in the country since the start of the year. The U.S. State Department said in a statement that it was "deeply concerned" by the report's findings and urged the Afghan government to take action against those responsible for the violence. The United States and its NATO allies have been accused of supporting the Taliban in the fight against the government of President Hamid Karzai, who has been in power for more than two years. The United Nations has also accused the Taliban of using women as human shields in the war against the country's Taliban and other militant groups. In a statement, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHRC) said the report showed that "women's rights are not just a matter of rights but also a human rights issue." The UNHRC said it was concerned that the report was based on a "
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Hip-hop star Nelly has been arrested on drug charges in Tennessee after a state trooper pulled over the private bus in which he was traveling, authorities said. The 40-year-old rapper from St. Louis, who shot to fame 15 years ago with the track `` Country Grammar, '' has been charged with felony possession of drugs, simple possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia, the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security said. The state trooper stopped the bus carrying Nelly and five other people on Interstate 40 in Putnam County on Saturday because it wasn't displaying U.S. Department of Transportation and International Fuel Tax Association stickers, according to Tennessee authorities. The trooper was about to conduct an inspection of the bus, a Prevost motor coach, when he `` noticed an odor of marijuana emitting from the vehicle, '' authorities said in a statement. Two troopers then searched the bus, finding `` five colored crystal-type rocks that tested positive for methamphetamine, as well as a small amount of marijuana and other drug paraphernalia, '' the statement said. The search also turned up several handguns and 100 small Ziploc bags, which the statement said are commonly used for selling drugs. The guns included a.40-caliber pistol and a.38-caliber revolver, the statement added. The driver of the vehicle was arrested and charged with misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance and possession with intent to distribute cocaine. The case is being investigated by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

-LRB- CNN -RRB- Hillary Clinton is finally announcing her candidacy for the 2016 presidential election. Although she has watched her standing in the polls sag in recent months, there is likely to be a boost in the days that follow the announcement. For Democrats, there is ample reason to be excited about Clinton's run for the presidency. She is certainly one of the strongest candidates in many decades. She brings to the table extensive political and policy experience, a combination of skills that is often lacking. She has been through some of the roughest partisan wars and emerged stronger than ever before. She has a keen sense about the nature of the modern news media, how to use it to her advantage and how to survive scandal frenzies. She is a hardened, tough partisan who will not shy away from Republican attack. Americans have many positive memories of Clinton name, given the booming economy of the late 1990s during Bill Clinton's presidency. If Hillary Clinton puts together an effective campaign, she could be unbeatable in the Democratic primaries as well as in the general election. However, during the buildup to her final decision, some of her weaknesses have also been exposed. Clinton doesn't want to end up like Vice President Al Gore in 2000. Although he did not win the popular vote, he did win the Electoral College by a wide margin. Clinton has been criticized for her lack of foreign policy experience. She does not have the temperament to be commander-in-chief, but she does have the experience to lead the nation in the fight against terrorism. She also does not want to be president of the United States of America, which means that she will have to deal with the challenges of the 21st century in a way that does not alienate the American people. In addition, she does not believe that she can win the White House on her own terms, but rather that she has the ability to win the presidency on the strength of her experience and leadership. Clinton is a strong leader, and she has shown that she is willing to take on the challenges that come with being president. In fact, she has been able to overcome many of the obstacles she faced during her time as a senator, including the
Des Moines, Iowa -LRB- CNN -RRB- Martin O'Malley told reporters in Iowa on Friday that inevitability -- a term bandied about regarding Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton -- is not unbreakable. `` I've seen it before, '' the former Governor of Maryland and possible presidential contender said. `` History is full of examples where the inevitable frontrunner was inevitable right up until she was no longer or he was no longer inevitable. '' Clinton was considered inevitable to win the nomination in 2008 but ended up losing to Barack Obama. O'Malley had previously dropped the inevitability comment in a television interview last month. The former governor, who capped off his two-day trip to the first-in-the-nation caucus state with a speech to the Polk County Democrats in Des Moines, said that although Clinton is an `` eminently qualified candidate, '' the Democratic Party is full of `` good leaders. '' `` History is full of examples where people who are not very well known nationally can be very well known once they are willing to make their case to the people of Iowa, '' O'Malley said. In some polls, he has scored in the low single digits in the state. In a March CNN/ORC poll of national Democrats, only 1 percent of registered voters said they would vote for Clinton if she won the nomination. In the same poll, only 2 percent said they were likely to vote for her if she lost the nomination. Clinton's campaign has said she will not run for president if she loses the nomination, but her campaign has also said she would not run in the general election if she wins the White House. Clinton has said that if she is elected president, she will be the first female president of the United States. She has also called for an end to the war in Iraq, saying that it is time to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. She also said that she would like to see the U.S. military withdraw from Afghanistan. Clinton has also been critical of President Barack Obama's handling of the Iraq war, calling it a waste of American lives and saying that he should be held accountable for his actions. Clinton said that Obama should not have been involved in the
New Delhi -LRB- CNN -RRB- An Indian software pioneer and nine others have been sentenced to seven years in jail for their role in what has been dubbed India's biggest corporate scandal in memory, police said. Ramalinga Raju, the former chairman of software services exporter Satyam Computers Services, was also fined $ 804,000, R.K. Gaur, a spokesman for India's Central Bureau of Investigation, told CNN. In 2009, Satyam Computers Services was at the center of a massive $ 1.6 billion fraud case after its then-chairman Raju admitted inflating profits with fictitious assets and nonexistent cash. Investigators say losses to investors resulting from the company's book manipulation were much higher. A special court convicted Raju and nine other people of cheating, criminal conspiracy, breach of public trust and other charges, said the Central Bureau of Investigation, which looked into the case. In the media, the case has been compared to the 2001 Enron Corp. scandal, in which a Houston energy company's earnings had been overstated by several hundred million dollars. When the scam made headlines, Satyam, which means `` truth '' in Sanskrit, was India's fourth-largest software company and the largest in the world, according to the World Economic Forum. The company was fined $ 2.5 billion by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its role in the scheme. The case is the latest in a string of high-profile corruption cases in India, including the case of former chief minister Manmohan Singh, who was sentenced to life in prison for his role in a scheme to defraud the government of more than $ 1 billion.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>
-LRB- CNN -RRB- When photographer Johan Bavman became a father for the first time, he took more than a passing wonder about how his native Sweden is said to be the most generous nation on Earth for parental leave. He immersed himself in fatherhood -- twice over, you might say. He used his photography to document the real-life experience of other fathers taking full advantage of Sweden's extraordinary program, which allows mothers and fathers to take long, long leaves from their careers so they can care for their newborns. Get this : Sweden grants a total of 480 calendar days of parental leave, with 390 of them paid at 80 % of income, with a maximum of 3,160 euros a month or $ 3,474. The remaining 90 days are paid at a flat-rate benefit of 20 euros a day, or $ 22. But there's a catch. Fathers have to share that leave with mothers. So to promote both parents to raise their children, Sweden has mandated that 60 of the 480 days be `` daddy months '' or `` partner months. '' If the 60 daddy days aren't used, they are lost, reducing the maximum leave to 420 days. The country also created a `` gender equality bonus '' : the more days a father takes, the more he gets paid, and the more time he spends with his children, the less time he has to spend with his wife and children. In other words, if a father has to take more than 40 days of paternity leave to raise a child, he will get paid less than his wife or children. And if a mother takes more than 30 days to raise her child, she will get less than her husband or children, and so on. In short, if you're a father and you want your children to grow up with you, you're going to have to pay more than your wife or kids, and you're not going to be able to afford to do so. And that's why it's so important that fathers get paid more than their wives or kids. It's not just about the money, it's about the quality of the work you're doing. If you want to be a good father, you
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Craig Hicks, who is charged in the deaths of three Muslim college students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, earlier this year, can face the death penalty, a judge ruled Monday, according to CNN affiliates. Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson Jr. ruled that Hicks'case is `` death penalty qualified, '' WRAL and WTVD reported. The 46-year-old was arrested February 10 in the deaths of Yusor Mohammad, 21, her 23-year-old husband, Deah Shaddy Barakat, and 19-year-old sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha. All three were shot in the head. Hicks, who was the victims'neighbor, turned himself in to police the night of the killings. The next week, he was indicted on three counts of first-degree murder and a count of discharging a firearm into an occupied dwelling. He had no prior criminal record, police said. Police said `` an ongoing neighbor dispute over parking '' might have been a factor in the shootings but also said they weren't dismissing the possibility of a hate crime. On what is believed to be Hicks'Facebook page, numerous posts rail against religion. The victims'family members have called on authorities to investigate the case. Hicks has been charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Raleigh, North Carolina, on April 15. He is being held on $100,000 bail.
